1
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:29,664
We're screwed.

2
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,837
No more free wi-fi.

3
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,506
- Hey, Ki-jung!
- Yeah?

4
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,799
The lady upstairs put
a password on 'iptime'.

5
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,971
A password?

6
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:42,765
Did you try 123456789?

7
00:01:42,855 --> 00:01:43,971
No luck.

8
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:45,475
Do it the other way.

9
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:47,148
I tried that too!

10
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:51,232
Fuck, then we can't get WhatsApp?

11
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:52,688
Nothing.

12
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:54,860
Hey, Kim Ki-taek.

13
00:01:55,784 --> 00:02:0-1,118
Don't fucking pretend to sleep.
What do you think?

14
00:02:0-1,788 --> 00:02:05,455
Our phones are shut off.
Now our wifi is shut off.

15
00:02:06,295 --> 00:02:08,082
What's your plan?

16
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,132
- Ki-woo.
- Yes, Dad?

17
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:16,757
For wifi, hold it high.

18
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:21,926
Stick it in every corner and so on.

19
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:29,520
Damn stink bugs.

20
00:02:30,444 --> 00:02:32,606
Over here! I got it!

21
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:34,028
Really? You got a signal?

22
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:35,855
Yeah, see?

23
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:38,571
This one, 'coffeeland 2G'.

24
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:40,698
Did a new cafe open?

25
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:42,495
Why can't I get it?

26
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:44,163
Climb up here.

27
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:45,535
Hey kids.

28
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:47,993
- Does it work?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:50,420
Then check WhatsApp.

30
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:53,415
Pizza Generation said they'd contact me.

31
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:55,170
Hold on.

32
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:57,969
Here it is. Pizza Generation.

33
00:03:01,308 --> 00:03:04,301
Wow! Check this out, guys.

34
00:03:05,104 --> 00:03:08,313
If we go as fast as her,
we can finish today.

35
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:09,685
Then we can get paid.

36
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:12,893
- Should we stand up too?
- She's a pro.

37
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,108
What? Fumigation?

38
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:19,566
They still do that kind of thing?

39
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,660
Guess so.

40
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:21,536
Shut the window.

41
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:24,029
Leave it open.
We'll get free extermination.

42
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:25,705
Kill the stink bugs.

43
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,454
Right, too many stink bugs
these days...

44
00:03:30,838 --> 00:03:32,875
God, that smells!

45
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,341
I told you to shut it!

46
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:39,381
Should I shut it, Dad?

47
00:03:50,232 --> 00:03:52,315
What exactly is the problem?

48
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:55,936
Take this one as an example.

49
00:03:56,238 --> 00:04:0-2,446
You call this a straight line?

50
00:04:0-2,824 --> 00:04:00,656
And why's it folded here?

51
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:02,609
Why is this sticking up?

52
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:05,119
You didn't even fold it.

53
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:10,291
A quarter of them look like this.

54
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:12,869
So 1 out of 4 are rejects.

55
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,793
So you're really docking
10% off our pay?

56
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,713
Considering the rejects,
that's a low penalty, isn't it?

57
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:28,351
Our pay is so low already!
How can you do this?

58
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:31,179
Look here.

59
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:33,856
This is not some minor issue.

60
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:39,192
You know what one shitty box
can do to our brand image?

61
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,733
Brand? You can't even afford
a box folder!

62
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:44,237
What did you say?

63
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:46,445
Boss.

64
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:48,600
This is all because
of that guy, right?

65
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:49,624
What guy?

66
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,372
Your part-time worker.
He's gone AWOL, right?

67
00:04:53,587 --> 00:04:57,581
Just when the Love of God Church
made a huge group order?

68
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:0-1,924
How do you know all that?

69
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:01,626
Who told you?

70
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,711
My sister knows the guy.

71
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:08,175
He's always been a bit strange.
Got a bad reputation.

72
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,306
Speaking of which, Boss.

73
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:13,104
We'll accept a 10% penalty.

74
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,226
In return...

75
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:15,397
In return?

76
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:18,268
Any thought of hiring
a new part-time worker?

77
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:21,817
Sis, we need someone!

78
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:25,359
Ditch the guy you've got now.
Just fire him.

79
00:05:26,078 --> 00:05:29,367
Tomorrow I'll come for
a formal interview. What time?

80
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:30,947
Wait, hold on a sec.

81
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,083
Let me think about it.

82
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,503
Then for now,
just pay for the boxes.

83
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:47,631
So we're all gathered here today,

84
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:51,722
to celebrate the reconnection
of our phones,

85
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:55,476
and this bounteous wi-fi!

86
00:05:55,566 --> 00:06:0-2,809
Look at that bastard.
It's not even dark yet.

87
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:03,359
Why didn't you put up
a 'No Urinating' sign?

88
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:04,407
I told you!

89
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:08,778
No, signs like that
just make them piss even more.

90
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:10,953
At least shout at him!

91
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,530
Don't shout.

92
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:14,581
"Please don't piss!"

93
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:19,371
Hey, is that Min?

94
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:22,169
Hey mister, that's not a toilet.

95
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,625
Way to go, Min.

96
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:25,756
Hey, punk!

97
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:29,010
Who are you staring at, asshole?

98
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:32,430
Come here! You little shit.

99
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:36,388
Get a fucking grip!

100
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:39,895
That's an impressive friend.

101
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:42,853
College students have
a real vigor to them.

102
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:44,113
Not like my brother.

103
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:47,531
But is he coming here?
Did you invite him?

104
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:48,699
No.

105
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:49,908
Hello!

106
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:51,531
Oh hi, Min!

107
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:52,872
Min!

108
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:53,748
Are you well, sir?

109
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:56,287
- Sure.
- What are you doing here?

110
00:06:56,376 --> 00:07:0-2,242
I texted you. Didn't you see it?

111
00:07:0-2,587 --> 00:07:0-1,748
Sorry, were you eating?

112
00:07:0-1,838 --> 00:07:01,124
No, we weren't eating.

113
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:03,501
- How are you, Ki-jung?
- Fine, you too?

114
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:06,300
We could've met outside,
why come here?

115
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:07,261
Because of this.

116
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:10,050
It's for you,
but it's so heavy.

117
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:12,515
Really? Put it down here.

118
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,060
Wow, what is that?

119
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:17,762
When I said I was meeting Ki-woo,

120
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:21,315
my grandfather insisted
I bring this to you.

121
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,613
Is this a landscape type?

122
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:30,779
Or you can see it
as an abstract type.

123
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:32,531
Wow, you know these!

124
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:36,615
My grandpa has collected scholar's rocks
since his cadet days.

125
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:40,285
Now the annex, the study,
every room in the house

126
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:42,336
is filled with these things.

127
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:46,420
But this stone here is said
to bring material wealth to families...

128
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,751
Min!

129
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:50,879
This is so metaphorical.

130
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:54,390
For sure.
It's a very opportune gift.

131
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:55,351
Of course.

132
00:07:55,352 --> 00:08:0-1,346
Please relay our deepest
thanks to your grandpa.

133
00:08:0-1,606 --> 00:08:01,393
Food would be better.

134
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,574
What was that called?
A landscape stone?

135
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:16,116
You collect those rocks too?

136
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:20,951
Hey, thanks to that rock
I saw your parents, they look healthy.

137
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:26,047
They're plenty healthy,
just out of work.

138
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,752
Is Ki-jung taking lessons
these days?

139
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:34,760
She can't afford lessons.

140
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,107
Cute, huh?

141
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:48,444
She's the one you're tutoring?

142
00:08:48,572 --> 00:08:50,689
Park Da-hye.
High school sophomore.

143
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:54,280
You take over
as her English tutor.

144
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:55,867
What do you mean?

145
00:08:55,954 --> 00:09:0-2,071
Tutor a rich kid.
It pays well.

146
00:09:0-1,207 --> 00:09:00,539
She's a nice girl.

147
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:03,584
Look after her while
I'm studying abroad.

148
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:07,755
What about your university friends?

149
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:11,209
Why ask a loser like me?

150
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:13,253
Why do you think?

151
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,051
Just the thought makes me sick.

152
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:20,389
Those disgusting frat boys
slavering over Da-hye?

153
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,220
It's revolting.

154
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:29,397
You like her?

155
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:36,610
Hey, I'm serious.

156
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:41,956
When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out.

157
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:44,458
So you take care of
her until then.

158
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:48,208
If it's you,
I can leave in peace.

159
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,793
Thanks for your trust,

160
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,463
but do I have to pretend to be
a college student?

161
00:10:0-2,433 --> 00:10:01,221
Ki-woo, think about it.

162
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:05,396
For years including
your military service,

163
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:07,648
you took the university entrance
exam 4 times.

164
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:10,902
Grammar, vocabulary,
composition, conversation...

165
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:13,104
When it comes to English,

166
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:17,659
you can teach 10 times better than
those drunken college pricks.

167
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:21,412
- I guess so.
- Sure!

168
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,409
But will they hire me?
I'm not a college student.

169
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:27,126
Just fake it.

170
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:30,922
Don't worry, you'll have
my recommendation, plus...

171
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:34,421
How should I describe the mother...?

172
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,424
She's a bit simple.

173
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:39,759
Young and simple.

174
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,057
Simple?

175
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:42,891
What do you mean?

176
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,933
Anyway, it's all good.
I had fun there.

177
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:48,856
So you agree?

178
00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:50,399
I guess so.

179
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:55,439
Hey, you said
your sister is artistic?

180
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:57,398
Good at Photoshop?

181
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:04,121
God, with skills like this,
why can't you get into art school?

182
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:05,539
Shut up.

183
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:10,245
Hey, no smoking in here.

184
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:11,704
Yeah, yeah. Gimme that.

185
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:12,914
Yeah.

186
00:11:17,387 --> 00:11:19,925
Now the cherry on top...

187
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:25,969
Wow, does Oxford have
a major in document forgery?

188
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:29,514
Ki-jung would be top of her class.

189
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:32,229
She's amazing, huh?

190
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:37,860
Our boy's going for a job interview.
Wish him luck.

191
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:39,649
Son.

192
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:43,320
I'm proud of you.

193
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:44,779
Dad.

194
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:48,658
I don't think of this
as forgery or crime.

195
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:51,001
I'll go to this university
next year.

196
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:54,455
So you've got a plan!

197
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:0-2,338
I just printed out the document
a bit early.

198
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:35,371
<i>Who is it?</i>

199
00:12:35,632 --> 00:12:37,624
Madame? Good afternoon.

200
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,546
I'm here on Min's recommendation...

201
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:41,377
<i>Oh right, come in.</i>

202
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:44,047
Thank you.

203
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:16,879
Hello!

204
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,131
Hello, Madame.

205
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:22,794
I just work here.
Come this way.

206
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:24,837
The yard is so nice.

207
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:26,593
The inside's nice too.

208
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:30,301
You know the architect Namgoong?
He's famous.

209
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:33,016
He used to live in this house.

210
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:37,433
He designed it himself.

211
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:45,400
As you can see,
now it's a playpen.

212
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:47,110
This way.

213
00:13:49,247 --> 00:13:51,739
Sit yourself down here.
I'll bring the madame.

214
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,040
Yes.

215
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,341
<i>Madame.</i>

216
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:08,548
<i>Madame?</i>

217
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:12,385
Madame?

218
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:15,638
Madame?

219
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:21,485
He's here.
The tutoring candidate.

220
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,442
I don't care about documents.

221
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:30,407
Min recommended you, after all.

222
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:37,160
As you know, Min is such
a brilliant human being.

223
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:40,083
Da-hye and I were quite happy
with him.

224
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:43,465
Regardless of her grades.
Know what I mean?

225
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:44,754
Yes.

226
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:46,965
He was marvelous.

227
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:54,053
So to be honest, we wanted to stick
with him through high school.

228
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:57,681
But all of a sudden
he's going abroad.

229
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:05,526
Anyway, excuse me,
but if I can speak directly,

230
00:15:05,782 --> 00:15:10,618
if you're not up
to Min's level, then,

231
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:13,161
I'm not sure
what the point is.

232
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,705
So anyway,
what I want to say is,

233
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:24,336
for your first lesson today,
do you mind if I sit in?

234
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,378
I want to see it full time,
how you run your lesson.

235
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:32,594
Is it okay with you?

236
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:02,999
You sure about #24?

237
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:15,220
Da-hye, you solved those later problems
then went back to #24.

238
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:16,884
Right?

239
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:19,762
Yes.

240
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:32,450
If that were the first question
on a real exam, you'd be screwed.

241
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,784
Look at this.
Your pulse is racing.

242
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:42,915
The heart doesn't lie.

243
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:47,422
An exam is like slashing through
a jungle.

244
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:50,084
Lose that momentum
and you're finished.

245
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:52,845
The answer to #24?
I don't care.

246
00:16:53,056 --> 00:17:0-2,142
Slashing through the exam,
dominating it!

247
00:17:0-2,853 --> 00:17:00,435
That's all I care about.

248
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:05,103
What you need is vigor.

249
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:07,818
Vigor.

250
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:10,438
Understand?

251
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:24,285
So I'll pay you
this time each month.

252
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:27,668
3 classes a week,
2 hours each, okay?

253
00:17:28,383 --> 00:17:29,499
As for the fee,

254
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:33,461
I was going to pay Min's rate,
then I added a bit for inflation.

255
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:34,841
Thank you.

256
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:38,390
How about a proper introduction?

257
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:41,514
Da-hye's tutor,
we'll call him Kevin.

258
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:43,725
Mr. Kevin!

259
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:47,391
If you feel like snacking
during your lesson, just call me.

260
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,897
If you need anything, ask her.

261
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:52,526
She knows this house better than I...

262
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:55,775
Da-song, stop it!

263
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:57,951
I'm sorry, did he startle you?

264
00:18:0-2,037 --> 00:18:00,529
How cute. His name's Da-song?

265
00:18:00,623 --> 00:18:02,364
Yes, our youngest.

266
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:04,166
Da-song, come say hi!

267
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:05,788
This is Mr. Kevin!

268
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:12,667
This is an Indian arrow.
I ordered it from the U.S.

269
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,503
From last year he's been
an Indian fanatic.

270
00:18:17,515 --> 00:18:18,926
Indians?

271
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:22,347
He's got a fanboy personality?

272
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,184
Well, he's eccentric
and easily distracted,

273
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:28,561
he can barely sit still!

274
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:31,189
So last year I enrolled him
in Cub Scouts,

275
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,272
hoping he'd learn moderation
and focus.

276
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:35,776
But look.

277
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:38,112
He's even worse.

278
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:45,533
His scout leader is an Indian fanatic,
maybe that's why.

279
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:50,462
The American Indian is
the very spirit of the Cub Scouts.

280
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:51,584
It's a good thing.

281
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:54,633
Were you a Cub Scout, Kevin?

282
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:57,795
Sure, I'm a Scout by nature.

283
00:19:0-2,097 --> 00:19:02,182
Da-song is an artist by nature.
Look at this painting.

284
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:06,020
It's so metaphorical.
It's really strong.

285
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:07,813
Strong, right?

286
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:10,019
You've got an eye for this.

287
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,109
It's a chimpanzee, right?

288
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:14,653
A self-portrait.

289
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:19,278
Sure enough!

290
00:19:20,495 --> 00:19:23,863
The perspective of
a young artist eludes understanding.

291
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,327
Or perhaps it's Da-song's
expressive genius...

292
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:31,795
Anyway, we've been through
so many art teachers.

293
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:34,339
None of them lasts even a month.

294
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:38,927
And Da-song is just so hard
to control.

295
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,932
- Just a moment, Madame.
- Yes?

296
00:19:44,352 --> 00:19:47,561
Someone just came to mind.

297
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:49,813
What was her name?

298
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,812
Jessica! Right, Jessica...

299
00:19:53,152 --> 00:19:57,237
She was in the same art school
as my cousin.

300
00:19:57,532 --> 00:20:0-1,899
What was her Korean name?

301
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:05,325
Anyway, after studying applied arts
at Illinois State University,

302
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:07,372
she returned to Korea.

303
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,575
Illinois... tell me more.

304
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,961
Her teaching is unusual,
but she knows how to handle kids.

305
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:19,464
She's got a special reputation
in her field.

306
00:20:19,846 --> 00:20:22,259
But even though
her methods are unique,

307
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:24,886
she can help kids get
into good art schools.

308
00:20:24,976 --> 00:20:29,016
Now I'm really curious.
What is she like?

309
00:20:29,272 --> 00:20:30,854
Would you like to meet her?

310
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:34,233
Though I heard she's
in high demand...

311
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,691
Hold on.

312
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:46,741
Jessica, only child,
Illinois Chicago,

313
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:49,699
classmate Kim Jin-mo,
he's your cousin.

314
00:20:56,841 --> 00:21:00,881
Look at how he painted the side
dishes on the tablecloth

315
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:03,379
in this mosaic arrangement.

316
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:06,306
But within that too,
there are repeating patterns.

317
00:21:06,476 --> 00:21:09,560
Gochujang is red, the rice...
well, anyway,

318
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:14,561
he has a Basquiat-esque sense,
even at age 9!

319
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:16,483
How exciting.

320
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:21,864
I'm sure Miss Jessica
must have already sensed this,

321
00:21:22,158 --> 00:21:26,072
so I'll leave you two,
and go up for Da-hye's lesson.

322
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:28,328
Have a nice lesson, Jessica.

323
00:21:28,498 --> 00:21:30,330
Yes, thank you for the introduction.

324
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:39,749
So as you can see,
Da-song's eccentric genius...

325
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:43,719
Da-hye.

326
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:47,093
So we'll start with #38?

327
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:52,932
Kevin.

328
00:21:53,064 --> 00:21:54,225
Yeah?

329
00:21:54,398 --> 00:22:0-1,314
Did you know that Da-song is
faking it all?

330
00:22:0-1,779 --> 00:22:02,146
Huh? What do you mean?

331
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,068
It's all a show.

332
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:08,027
Acting like a genius,
that 4th dimension stuff is all fake.

333
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,827
An artist cosplay.

334
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:11,530
Da-song?

335
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:14,374
You know that thing,

336
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,579
when he freezes and stares at the sky,
as if struck by inspiration.

337
00:22:19,257 --> 00:22:24,798
So he's walking along, then he stares
at the clouds for 10 minutes.

338
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:27,178
So you know what I mean?

339
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,882
He gives me the creeps.

340
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,177
He pretends that he can't live
a normal life.

341
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:35,270
Makes me want to puke.

342
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:38,394
So Da-song is pretending...

343
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:42,895
But what's that got to do
with your studies?

344
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:50,862
Well, I'm just saying.

345
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,453
Sure, so in that sense,

346
00:22:56,586 --> 00:23:00,671
what you told me
about Da-song was very interesting,

347
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:03,039
so let's write about it
in English.

348
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:09,304
And be sure to use the word 'pretend'
at least twice.

349
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:13,012
Then, can I ask you a question?

350
00:23:13,102 --> 00:23:14,218
Sure.

351
00:23:14,312 --> 00:23:16,804
That teacher Jessica.

352
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:23,562
Is she really your cousin's classmate?

353
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:27,280
What do you mean?

354
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,650
She's your girlfriend, right?

355
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:36,787
No way... I just met her today.

356
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:43,956
Jessica's really pretty,
isn't she?

357
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:46,546
Aren't you interested?

358
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,302
You saw her?

359
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:53,970
Sure, she's pretty.
She's a beautiful woman.

360
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:55,308
Yeah.

361
00:23:57,229 --> 00:24:00,097
I knew it.

362
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,940
So you are interested.

363
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:07,070
Da-hye...

364
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:16,456
So, if we can compare Jessica
to a rose,

365
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,031
then you are...

366
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,583
- Let's study.
- Yes.

367
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:10,885
Please understand that
my boy has trouble keeping still.

368
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,336
I understand.

369
00:25:12,722 --> 00:25:13,963
Da-song!

370
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:16,182
Da-song, get up!

371
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:17,765
Come on, Da-song!

372
00:25:17,977 --> 00:25:19,684
In your butt...

373
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,183
- Madame, please leave us.
- What?

374
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,307
I never teach with a parent
in the room.

375
00:25:25,568 --> 00:25:27,981
But today is our first day,
and as you can see, he's...

376
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,777
Wait downstairs.

377
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,526
Park Da-song?

378
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:33,732
Da-song!

379
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:38,988
Madame?

380
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,623
Want some plum extract?

381
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:42,745
What?

382
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:46,036
It's mixed with honey.
To ease your tension.

383
00:25:46,172 --> 00:25:48,084
Yeah, that would be great.

384
00:26:03,147 --> 00:26:04,888
- Hey.
- Yes?

385
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:06,640
I've got an idea.

386
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:09,898
Take two glasses of plum
extract to Da-song's room.

387
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:13,147
You're not a parent,
so you can go in!

388
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,731
Oh, that's right!

389
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:17,951
Then I'll report back on
what's going on in there...

390
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:20,328
Why didn't I think of it earlier?

391
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:23,949
What?

392
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,451
They came out?

393
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:26,961
Yeah.

394
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:32,382
So you're done already?

395
00:26:33,803 --> 00:26:35,044
Madame.

396
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:37,678
Come sit next to me.

397
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,470
Da-song, go upstairs.

398
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:44,636
Hurry up!

399
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:53,110
Da-song just painted this.

400
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:54,404
I see...

401
00:26:56,075 --> 00:27:0-2,533
I'd rather speak with Madame alone.

402
00:27:0-2,828 --> 00:27:0-1,989
Oh, but she is...

403
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,662
No, leave us.

404
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:08,460
Madame,

405
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:13,291
I told you I study art psychology
and art therapy?

406
00:27:13,384 --> 00:27:14,670
Yes.

407
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:17,927
Did anything happen to Da-song
in first grade?

408
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,890
To be frank,

409
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,553
before I decide whether
to take on Da-song,

410
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:29,105
I need to hear about this.

411
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:33,527
But this is hard for me
to talk about right now.

412
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:34,654
What to do?

413
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:36,021
Never mind, then.

414
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:41,744
The lower-right region of a painting is
called the 'schizophrenia zone'.

415
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:44,321
Psychotic symptoms
often reveal themselves here.

416
00:27:44,415 --> 00:27:45,415
Oh, phrenia...

417
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:46,457
Look here.

418
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,867
Da-song painted this unusual shape,
right?

419
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,377
I see.

420
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:55,332
Over there, it's the same!
It's the same, right?

421
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:57,292
Yes, that's correct.

422
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,213
A similar shape in the same zone.
You see it now?

423
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,631
Yes.

424
00:28:03,142 --> 00:28:07,307
I've stared at that painting
at every meal!

425
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:09,722
But I had no idea.

426
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:12,733
Calm down.
Let's compose ourselves.

427
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:16,482
This is all a black box
into Da-song's mind.

428
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:20,490
Would you like to
open that box with me, Madame?

429
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:23,068
I want to open it.

430
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:27,702
Then we'll need 4 two-hour sessions
per week,

431
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:32,001
and this is not simple tutoring,
it's art therapy, right?

432
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:33,087
Of course.

433
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:36,836
Because of that my rate is
set at a very high level.

434
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:38,676
Are you okay with that?

435
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,085
It's my pleasure.

436
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,342
Da-song's dad is home.

437
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:54,228
Honey, Da-song's new art teacher
is here.

438
00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:0-2,862
Her name's Jessica,
from Illinois.

439
00:29:0-1,406 --> 00:29:01,648
<i>Jessica! This is Dong-ik.</i>

440
00:29:01,784 --> 00:29:03,491
- Hello.
- Hi.

441
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:05,318
Thanks for your help.

442
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:06,653
Class is over?

443
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:07,954
Yes, just finished.

444
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:09,664
- Driver Yoon.
- Yes?

445
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,286
- Are you free?
- Yes, I am.

446
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:13,790
Then give her a lift, okay?

447
00:29:14,088 --> 00:29:18,549
Sure, we don't want her
going down alone at night, right?

448
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:19,750
Of course.

449
00:29:19,969 --> 00:29:21,335
Miss Jessica?

450
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:27,386
Shall I drive you
all the way home, then?

451
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:30,890
- Which neighborhood?
- No, that's fine.

452
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,564
You can just drop me off
at Hyehwa station.

453
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
Thank you.

454
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,392
I don't mind if it's far away.

455
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:41,196
- My shift is finished, anyway.
- I'll get off at Hyehwa.

456
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:44,695
Looks like it's going to rain.

457
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,911
Ride the Benz, not the subway!

458
00:29:48,998 --> 00:29:52,287
I'm meeting my boyfriend
at exit 3 of Hyehwa Station!

459
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:54,997
Yes.

460
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:33,536
Dad, when you worked as a driver,
did you drive a lot of Benzes?

461
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:35,666
Benzes?

462
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:40,421
Not then, but I did
when I worked as a valet.

463
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:43,716
You worked as a valet?

464
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:47,591
Sure, after the chicken place went bust,
before the Taiwan cake shop,

465
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,422
in that 6-month window?

466
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:52,884
No, it was after the cake shop
went bust.

467
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:57,935
We're moving
to the next stage already?

468
00:31:0-2,609 --> 00:31:02,193
I set a trap in the Benz.

469
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,066
Then we're diving right in.

470
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:06,322
Wow, this is so metaphorical.

471
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:10,452
Look Dad, we're eating in
a driver's cafeteria right now!

472
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:12,783
Right, a driver's cafeteria!

473
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,160
Eat as much as you want, kids.

474
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:18,077
You didn't even pay for it,
they did!

475
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:21,417
Son, have some more.
Eat up!

476
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:22,465
Yes, Dad.

477
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:23,582
Eat your fill!

478
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,792
What did you do
to that woman yesterday?

479
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:26,761
What?

480
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:28,344
She was freaking out.

481
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,506
Saying she was so moved,
you put her in shock.

482
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:32,265
Fuck, I don't know!

483
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:36,220
I googled 'art therapy',
and ad-libbed the rest.

484
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:38,722
Then suddenly she's weeping.

485
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,224
Crazy bitch,
I couldn't believe it.

486
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:17,010
Oh, you're home?

487
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:18,678
Did you eat yet?

488
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:22,140
Is something wrong?

489
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:23,566
Is the housekeeper out?

490
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:25,484
She's walking the dogs.

491
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,482
Honey.

492
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:30,615
This was under my car seat.

493
00:32:33,162 --> 00:32:35,370
Driver Yoon is such a scumbag.

494
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:37,118
What is this?

495
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,332
I'm sorry, honey.

496
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:41,542
I didn't know
he was this kind of guy.

497
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,287
Don't you pay him well?

498
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:48,045
Is he saving up by not paying
for a motel?

499
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:49,921
He must be a pervert.

500
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:51,298
He likes it in the car.

501
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:55,348
Oh, that's gross.
In his boss' car!

502
00:32:55,434 --> 00:33:0-1,553
A young guy's sex life is
his own business, that's all fine.

503
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,017
But why in my car?

504
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:11,114
And if so, why not in his seat?
Why cross the line like that?

505
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,566
You're right.

506
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:16,111
Does dripping his sperm
on my seat turn him on?

507
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,200
I can't believe this.

508
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:26,671
But you know
what's strangest of all?

509
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:28,923
What?

510
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:32,339
Usually if you have car sex,

511
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:37,508
you might leave behind
a strand of hair, or an earring.

512
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:38,849
Right.

513
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:42,478
But how can you forget
your own panties?

514
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:46,895
That's right.
It's hard to overlook.

515
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:52,022
So it makes me quite suspicious
of this woman's condition.

516
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:54,858
You get me?

517
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,035
<i>Oh my</i>... meth or cocaine?

518
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,495
Shh! The kids...

519
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:09,414
What do we do?

520
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:12,418
What if anyone finds white powder
in your car?

521
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:14,673
Calm down, relax.

522
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,637
Relax

523
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:20,429
For now it's just supposition.
A rational guess.

524
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:23,140
But no need to call the police.

525
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,766
Not that!

526
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:30,982
Still, for a busy man like me to ask,
"Why are you fucking in my car?"

527
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:32,562
Exactly.

528
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:34,488
So instead...

529
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:39,286
Can you just invent some bland
excuse to let him go?

530
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,991
Okay sure.

531
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:44,161
No need to mention panties
or car sex.

532
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,618
We don't need to stoop
to that level, do we?

533
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:48,419
Surely not!

534
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:52,211
But what if he goes online
and accuses us...

535
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:54,384
Just give him a good severance.

536
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:57,796
How was Da-song today?

537
00:35:0-2,140 --> 00:35:0-1,802
He was fine.

538
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,850
- So class is finished?
- Yes.

539
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:05,599
Jessica, the last time you came,

540
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:08,102
our driver gave you a ride,
right?

541
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:09,151
That's right.

542
00:35:09,152 --> 00:35:11,234
This may be an odd question,

543
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,485
but nothing happened then?

544
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:15,029
No, he was very nice.

545
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:16,902
I told him
to go to Hyehwa Station,

546
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:20,281
but he insisted
on driving me home.

547
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,454
That jerk!
He took you home late at night?

548
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,406
Revealing where you live?

549
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,451
No, I got off at Hyehwa.

550
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,878
Oh, good girl. Very good.

551
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:32,584
Jessica nice...

552
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:35,083
Did something happen with him?

553
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:40,430
He won't be working for us anymore.
A slightly shameful incident.

554
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:42,549
What incident?

555
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:45,226
Oh, you don't need to know.

556
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:50,724
But I'm surprised.
He was so gentlemanly and cool.

557
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:54,185
Jessica, you're too young
and innocent!

558
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,316
You have a lot to learn
about people.

559
00:35:57,032 --> 00:36:01,993
But we were excited to have such
a young, hip driver, too.

560
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,243
But isn't an older driver better?

561
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:09,201
That's true. They drive better,
have better manners.

562
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:12,078
My father's brother had
a driver just like that.

563
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:16,758
Mr. Kim.
He was so congenial and nice,

564
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:19,586
I used to call him Uncle
when I was young.

565
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,337
You know a man like that?

566
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:24,139
Yes, he was so mild-mannered.

567
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:29,558
Oh, but my relatives relocated
to Chicago.

568
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:33,016
I wonder if Mr.
Kim's free now?

569
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:37,107
I'm really interested!
Could I meet him?

570
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:38,313
Really?

571
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:40,694
I don't trust anyone now.

572
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:44,114
I only trust someone recommended
by a person I know well.

573
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:49,074
But if you've known him so long,
I'd feel much more at ease.

574
00:36:51,586 --> 00:36:53,202
Do you really want to meet him?

575
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:55,754
I'm deadly serious.

576
00:36:55,966 --> 00:37:0-1,505
This chain of recommendations
is best.

577
00:37:0-1,970 --> 00:37:01,461
How should I describe it?

578
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,137
A belt of trust?

579
00:37:03,306 --> 00:37:04,592
- This one's different.
- Here.

580
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:05,349
Oh, right.

581
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,716
And this one.

582
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:08,684
Looks like a touch screen now.

583
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,353
It's not touch,
it says you have to turn it.

584
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,477
Wow, this thing?

585
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:15,187
Sir?

586
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:17,360
Taking our time, are we?

587
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,031
This is a nice car.

588
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:26,236
This is it!
Come over here.

589
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,662
He's in a meeting now.

590
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:38,247
Have a seat and wait here.

591
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,468
Hello, nice to meet...

592
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,226
But is it compatible
with a phone?

593
00:37:55,317 --> 00:38:01,655
Oh, not with a phone.
You need more computing power.

594
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:07,489
This isn't any sort of test,
so don't be nervous.

595
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:11,823
I was worn out at the office,
so I came out for a bit.

596
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,165
I understand.

597
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:17,830
Constant chatter, all that bother.
At least the car is peaceful.

598
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,586
Thank you.

599
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:23,793
You seem to know the roads well?

600
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:27,051
Anything below the 38th parallel.

601
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:30,641
After 30 years behind the wheel,
the car almost drives itself.

602
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:33,595
I respect those who work
in one field for a long time.

603
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,688
Well, to be honest,
this is a simple vocation.

604
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:39,893
But... the head of a household,

605
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:42,232
the leader of a company?

606
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:47,109
Or else just a lonely man setting off
on the road each morning...

607
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:49,865
It's companionship of a sort,

608
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:53,039
so that's how I've approached each day.

609
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,374
The years sure pass quickly.

610
00:39:0-2,839 --> 00:39:01,331
Sure enough,
your cornering is excellent.

611
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:08,130
Well, it may look simple,
but it's one of the fundamentals.

612
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:13,097
<i>She may look like a sheep,
but inside, she's a fox.</i>

613
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,388
<i>Sometimes she acts like
she owns the house.</i>

614
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:18,023
<i>Right.</i>

615
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:22,481
<i>Of all the people in that house,
she's lived there the longest.</i>

616
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:26,189
<i>She was housekeeper
to the architect Namgoong,</i>

617
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:30,698
<i>but then she went on to work
for this family.</i>

618
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:32,949
<i>When the architect moved out,</i>

619
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,907
<i>he introduced this woman
to Park's family,</i>

620
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:39,376
<i>telling them, "This is a great housekeeper,
you should hire her."</i>

621
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:42,796
<i>So she survived
a change of ownership.</i>

622
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,876
She won't give up
a good job easily.

623
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:49,675
To extract a woman like that,
we need to prepare well.

624
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:53,599
Right, we need a plan.

625
00:39:54,769 --> 00:40:0-2,012
I want to eat peaches.
I like peaches best.

626
00:40:0-2,607 --> 00:40:00,018
Why not ask for some?

627
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:03,601
No peaches at our house.
It's forbidden fruit.

628
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,370
<i>So according to
what Da-hye told me,</i>

629
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:18,783
<i>she's got a massively serious
allergy to peaches.</i>

630
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:22,245
<i>You know that fuzz
on a peach's skin?</i>

631
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:26,215
<i>If she's anywhere near it,
she gets a full body rash,</i>

632
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:30,045
<i>has trouble breathing, asthma,
a total meltdown!</i>

633
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:38,640
No no, there weren't
any peaches anywhere.

634
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,773
That's what I'm saying!

635
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,606
Usually when I get symptoms
like this,

636
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:48,988
I run to my room
and take my medicine,

637
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,661
but it was so sudden,
I wasn't sure where I left it.

638
00:40:54,829 --> 00:41:0-1,620
Madame, this woman behind me,
is that...?

639
00:41:0-1,876 --> 00:41:01,708
Oh, it's our housekeeper!

640
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:04,128
So it's true. Oh, how sad.

641
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:07,339
I wasn't sure
if that was really her.

642
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:11,427
I've only seen her a couple times
in the living room.

643
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:13,970
This was in the hospital?

644
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:17,846
A few days ago I went
for my annual medical exam.

645
00:41:18,353 --> 00:41:22,563
I took a selfie for my wife,
and there she was behind me.

646
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:25,191
Is she talking
on the phone there?

647
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:28,360
Anyway. I wasn't trying
to eavesdrop...

648
00:41:28,446 --> 00:41:30,312
I wasn't trying
to eavesdrop,

649
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:32,239
but her words
came through clearly!

650
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:34,112
- So I couldn't help but...!
- Cut, cut!

651
00:41:34,202 --> 00:41:37,161
Dad, your emotions are up
to here.

652
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:39,489
Bring them down to
about there.

653
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:42,499
...so I couldn't help
but overhear.

654
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:44,872
Keep it focused!

655
00:41:46,506 --> 00:41:49,123
What I'm trying to say is,
it's just that,

656
00:41:49,217 --> 00:41:53,257
your housekeeper's voice
is quite loud, you know?

657
00:41:53,638 --> 00:41:57,131
I understand, it's all right.
Just tell me, okay?

658
00:41:57,225 --> 00:42:00,093
She said she got diagnosed
with active TB,

659
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:02,143
and she was shouting
on the phone,

660
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,314
so upset she could
barely control herself!

661
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,767
Tuberculosis?
Come on...

662
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:13,027
It's true, she phoned someone
saying she had active TB.

663
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:18,077
Do people still get TB?

664
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,580
Dad...

665
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:24,792
Back in the day, people used
to buy Christmas Seals, right?

666
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,335
Feels like a bygone era.

667
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:27,878
But I saw it on the internet.

668
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:31,924
Korea has the #1 rate of TB
of all the OECD countries.

669
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,629
But she's still working,
as if nothing's wrong.

670
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:37,634
With a kid like Da-song
in the house.

671
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:40,808
So you've got a young kid
like Da-song in the house,

672
00:42:41,102 --> 00:42:44,220
and a TB patient is doing dishes,
cooking, spraying spittle...

673
00:42:44,314 --> 00:42:45,600
Stop it, please!

674
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:51,894
<i>Dad: Arriving in 3 mins</i>

675
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:42,574
If you get the chance,
this'll be icing on the cake.

676
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,568
<i>Madame</i>

677
00:44:14,654 --> 00:44:16,441
<i>2nd floor sauna room</i>

678
00:44:16,531 --> 00:44:17,738
<i>Don't let her see you</i>

679
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:29,909
- Have a seat.
- Yes.

680
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,916
Mr. Kim.

681
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:36,966
Please don't tell any of this
to my husband, okay?

682
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:38,213
Understood.

683
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:42,673
If he hears I brought
a TB patient to our home,

684
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:45,884
I'll be hanged and quartered!

685
00:44:45,977 --> 00:44:47,559
Don't worry, Madame.

686
00:44:47,937 --> 00:44:51,351
And if I may presume
to say one thing.

687
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:54,813
I have no feelings
against that woman.

688
00:44:55,361 --> 00:45:02,361
I felt I had to speak up for the sake
of public health and hygiene.

689
00:45:02,994 --> 00:45:06,533
But this could be
seen as snitching or...

690
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:07,989
Don't you worry.

691
00:45:08,082 --> 00:45:10,665
I won't mention the TB.

692
00:45:10,752 --> 00:45:13,165
I'll just make up some excuse
to dismiss her.

693
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:15,037
Simply and quietly.

694
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:19,129
It's a proven method.
That's the best.

695
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,801
Okay, then.

696
00:45:32,023 --> 00:45:34,891
Have you... washed your hands?

697
00:46:20,655 --> 00:46:24,865
Mr. Kim, do you know
a good braised ribs place?

698
00:46:24,951 --> 00:46:26,487
Somewhere close by.

699
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:27,944
Sure.

700
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,868
- Then you'll be eating out?
- That's right.

701
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,243
Why such a craving
for braised ribs today?

702
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:38,705
Our old housekeeper made delicious ribs.

703
00:46:39,632 --> 00:46:42,466
The one who quit this week?

704
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:46,887
My wife wouldn't even tell me
why she quit.

705
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:54,645
Sure, it's easy enough
to hire a new one.

706
00:46:55,898 --> 00:47:00,643
Still, it's a shame.
She was a great housekeeper.

707
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:01,737
I see.

708
00:47:01,779 --> 00:47:04,362
She kept the house
in great shape,

709
00:47:04,449 --> 00:47:07,066
and she knew never
to cross the line.

710
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,323
I can't stand people
who cross the line.

711
00:47:10,913 --> 00:47:13,576
Perhaps just one weak point?

712
00:47:14,292 --> 00:47:15,874
Eating too much.

713
00:47:16,002 --> 00:47:18,494
She always ate enough for two.

714
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:23,336
But considering all the work
she did...

715
00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:28,800
Then you better find someone new.
A new housekeeper.

716
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:30,930
We're in trouble now.

717
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:35,429
In a week, our house will be
a trash can.

718
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:39,057
My clothes will start
to smell.

719
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:43,360
My wife has no talent for housework.

720
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:46,780
She's bad at cleaning,
and her cooking's awful.

721
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,817
Still, you love her, right?

722
00:47:57,502 --> 00:48:00,586
Of course. I love her.

723
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:03,543
We'll call it love.

724
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:07,255
Then would this help?

725
00:48:11,307 --> 00:48:13,674
The Care?
What is this?

726
00:48:13,851 --> 00:48:16,218
I just recently found out
about them.

727
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:21,019
How to describe it?
It's like a membership service.

728
00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:28,231
The company provides veteran-grade
help to VIP customers such as you.

729
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:34,405
For example maids, caregivers,
or drivers like myself.

730
00:48:34,497 --> 00:48:37,456
You can tell from the card
they're high-class.

731
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:39,658
Cool design.

732
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,877
Then how do you know
about this company?

733
00:48:42,964 --> 00:48:47,299
They contacted me,
as a veteran-grade driver.

734
00:48:47,552 --> 00:48:49,794
You might say they scouted me?

735
00:48:51,013 --> 00:48:57,305
But when their call came I had
already arranged to meet with you.

736
00:49:0-2,729 --> 00:49:00,095
I see...

737
00:49:01,232 --> 00:49:04,475
You turned down this famous company
to work for me.

738
00:49:05,069 --> 00:49:06,731
I won't forget that.

739
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,147
Son of a bitch!

740
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,200
Anyway, I can give this card
to my wife, right?

741
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:18,121
Yes, that's why I brought it up.

742
00:49:18,207 --> 00:49:20,199
No need to mention me.

743
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:24,875
You can tell her
you found the company yourself.

744
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:26,706
Sure.

745
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:29,382
Thanks to you I can play
the good husband.

746
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:34,134
On the back, there's a number
for consultations.

747
00:49:34,348 --> 00:49:35,464
Tell her to call there...

748
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:36,844
Eyes on the road!

749
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:45,224
Hello, this is
Senior Advisor Yeo of The Care.

750
00:49:45,526 --> 00:49:48,610
Yes, this is The Care's main office?

751
00:49:48,779 --> 00:49:49,779
That's correct.

752
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,239
If she wanted, she'd be
a fucking great con artist.

753
00:49:53,326 --> 00:49:55,693
Isn't her voice tone great?
Takes after me.

754
00:49:57,288 --> 00:50:0-1,905
From what I've heard,
it's a full membership service?

755
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:03,917
So you're not currently
a member, I assume?

756
00:50:04,003 --> 00:50:06,586
<i>That's right. What steps do
I need to take?</i>

757
00:50:06,672 --> 00:50:10,791
We'll just need to receive
a few documents from you.

758
00:50:10,885 --> 00:50:13,798
Are you ready
to write this down?

759
00:50:13,971 --> 00:50:18,591
Your family register,
citizenship ID cards...

760
00:50:19,602 --> 00:50:22,436
...documents to prove
your income level,

761
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:25,014
i.e. the title to your property, etc.

762
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:27,349
Our property title?
Yes.

763
00:50:35,868 --> 00:50:37,404
Wow, peaches!

764
00:50:37,537 --> 00:50:39,278
You have some too, Mr. Kevin.

765
00:50:39,747 --> 00:50:40,988
Thank you.

766
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,832
Leave it outside
the door next time.

767
00:50:51,926 --> 00:50:54,589
- And knock!
- Yes.

768
00:50:57,431 --> 00:51:0-1,013
No entering during my lesson!

769
00:51:0-1,100 --> 00:51:00,181
Yes, miss!

770
00:51:02,728 --> 00:51:04,060
<i>Park Da-song!</i>

771
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:05,307
Daddy!

772
00:51:05,398 --> 00:51:06,855
<i>Where are you?</i>

773
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,481
Daddy!

774
00:51:12,572 --> 00:51:13,530
Son!

775
00:51:13,531 --> 00:51:15,147
Walkie talkies!

776
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:16,241
Walkie talkies?

777
00:51:16,325 --> 00:51:17,325
Walkie talkies!

778
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:20,619
Who do you like better,
your dad or the walkie talkie?

779
00:51:21,372 --> 00:51:23,910
Da-song, how could you run out
from your lesson?

780
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:27,831
When did you buy all this?

781
00:51:27,962 --> 00:51:28,998
It's no big deal.

782
00:51:29,088 --> 00:51:30,169
Huh?

783
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:34,337
Huh?

784
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:36,001
What is it?

785
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:40,047
What's he doing now?

786
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:42,682
Da-song, don't do that!

787
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:46,471
It's the same!
They smell the same!

788
00:51:46,689 --> 00:51:49,978
What are you talking about?
Go up to Jessica.

789
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:54,103
Jessica smells like that, too.

790
00:51:55,197 --> 00:52:0-2,816
So do we all need
to use different soap, now?

791
00:52:0-2,909 --> 00:52:02,778
Dad, we'll need to use
different laundry soap, too.

792
00:52:02,872 --> 00:52:04,033
And fabric softener.

793
00:52:04,123 --> 00:52:08,242
You mean doing four separate loads
of laundry each time?

794
00:52:08,419 --> 00:52:10,160
That's not it.

795
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,213
It's the semi-basement smell.

796
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:16,883
We need to leave this home
to lose the smell.

797
00:52:18,888 --> 00:52:24,634
Anyway, aren't we fortunate to be
worrying about things like this?

798
00:52:24,727 --> 00:52:25,763
Sure.

799
00:52:25,853 --> 00:52:28,721
In an age like ours,

800
00:52:29,148 --> 00:52:33,643
when an opening for a security guard
attracts 500 university graduates.

801
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:37,025
Our entire family got hired!

802
00:52:37,615 --> 00:52:39,231
That's right, Dad!

803
00:52:39,742 --> 00:52:42,200
If we put our 4 salaries together?

804
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:46,451
The amount of cash coming
from that house into ours is immense!

805
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:51,915
Let's offer a prayer of gratitude
to the great Mr. Park.

806
00:52:52,004 --> 00:52:53,085
And to Min!

807
00:52:53,172 --> 00:52:55,915
Ki-woo, that friend of yours
turned into such a fine guy,

808
00:52:56,008 --> 00:53:00,252
and thanks to him we're all...
Fuck, not again!

809
00:53:04,975 --> 00:53:05,975
That asshole's dead.

810
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,552
Ki-woo's on the rampage!

811
00:53:08,646 --> 00:53:10,808
Don't overdo it!

812
00:53:12,024 --> 00:53:14,562
Use this instead.

813
00:53:18,322 --> 00:53:19,563
Damn you!

814
00:53:22,368 --> 00:53:23,654
Get a fucking grip!

815
00:53:23,744 --> 00:53:25,235
Get a grip!

816
00:53:27,748 --> 00:53:29,114
Wow!

817
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:35,629
It's a deluge!

818
00:53:51,897 --> 00:53:56,232
Current weather is clear, over.
The clouds are moving.

819
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:0-2,731
<i>But they're not rain clouds,
over.</i>

820
00:54:0-2,821 --> 00:54:00,232
I hear you, over.

821
00:54:00,322 --> 00:54:06,489
Currently your sister's lip is
pouting like a duck's bill.

822
00:54:06,704 --> 00:54:09,447
She's super annoyed, over.

823
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:14,376
Can't I stay home and study English?
And call Kevin?

824
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:18,001
Hey! Don't make a scene
just as we're leaving.

825
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,423
If we have to go,
let's have fun.

826
00:54:20,509 --> 00:54:23,172
Da-hye, this is no ordinary
camping trip.

827
00:54:23,262 --> 00:54:24,095
That's right!

828
00:54:24,096 --> 00:54:26,213
How could you miss
your brother's birthday?

829
00:54:26,307 --> 00:54:27,056
No way!

830
00:54:27,057 --> 00:54:29,299
Even your busy father is
taking time off to go.

831
00:54:29,393 --> 00:54:32,181
Right! If you don't go,
you'll regret it!

832
00:54:34,565 --> 00:54:36,727
Oh, right.
You know the beam projector?

833
00:54:36,817 --> 00:54:37,817
The outdoor theater?

834
00:54:37,902 --> 00:54:39,768
Right, bring the outdoor
beam projector.

835
00:54:39,862 --> 00:54:40,654
Yes.

836
00:54:40,655 --> 00:54:44,773
And look for Da-song's
camping raincoat.

837
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:46,657
He loves it when it rains.

838
00:54:47,286 --> 00:54:51,246
You remember now?
Zoonie, Berry, and Foofoo.

839
00:54:51,332 --> 00:54:52,493
Zoonie and Berry get this.

840
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:55,371
Yes, Natural Balance Original Ultra.

841
00:54:55,461 --> 00:54:57,748
Right, and for Foofoo...

842
00:55:0-2,130 --> 00:55:0-1,746
Kani-kamaboko.
Japanese crab sticks.

843
00:55:0-1,840 --> 00:55:00,840
Yes.

844
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:03,879
When you walk Zoonie,
give him a long leash.

845
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:06,757
He needs to run around
to feel happy.

846
00:55:06,847 --> 00:55:09,464
He's like the canine version
of Da-song!

847
00:55:35,292 --> 00:55:36,783
Son!

848
00:55:37,253 --> 00:55:39,996
Why are you lying down outside?

849
00:55:40,256 --> 00:55:42,839
Isn't he hot out there?

850
00:55:43,801 --> 00:55:48,421
I'm gazing at the sky
from home.

851
00:55:50,057 --> 00:55:51,514
It's so great.

852
00:55:54,937 --> 00:55:57,099
Mom, want some water?

853
00:55:57,189 --> 00:56:0-2,396
There's sparkling, right?

854
00:56:0-2,691 --> 00:56:01,183
Ki-jung, some water?

855
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:03,269
Telepathy... thank you.

856
00:56:25,593 --> 00:56:26,834
Whoa.

857
00:56:29,597 --> 00:56:32,260
Wow, all these varieties
of alcohol.

858
00:56:33,225 --> 00:56:37,469
Dad! Let me add another
to the mix!

859
00:56:39,356 --> 00:56:41,018
This is pretty classy.

860
00:56:41,942 --> 00:56:46,607
Rain falling on the lawn,
as we sip our whiskey...

861
00:56:47,197 --> 00:56:51,942
Ki-woo, what's that yellow notebook
you've been carrying?

862
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:56,034
This?
It's Da-hye's diary.

863
00:56:56,123 --> 00:56:57,659
Her diary?

864
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:01,869
What a scumbag.
How could you read her diary?

865
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:07,834
Just so we can understand
each other deeper.

866
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:10,385
Fuck, are you two dating?

867
00:57:10,846 --> 00:57:14,840
I'm serious.
She really likes me too.

868
00:57:16,977 --> 00:57:18,434
A while back...

869
00:57:19,313 --> 00:57:20,520
Never mind.

870
00:57:21,607 --> 00:57:24,566
When she enters university,
I'll officially ask her out.

871
00:57:24,902 --> 00:57:26,188
Seriously.

872
00:57:30,866 --> 00:57:32,573
My son!

873
00:57:33,077 --> 00:57:37,412
Then this house will be
your in-laws' house?

874
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:40,998
That's right.

875
00:57:41,085 --> 00:57:45,045
Fuck, then I'm washing dishes
at my daughter-in-law's?

876
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:48,373
Sure, washing
your daughter-in-law's socks!

877
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:05,356
I like her.
She's a good kid.

878
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:09,853
She's pretty,
but she's not wild.

879
00:58:10,906 --> 00:58:15,150
Well, now that we're daydreaming...

880
00:58:16,412 --> 00:58:18,950
If Da-hye and I marry,

881
00:58:19,164 --> 00:58:22,874
we can bring in actors
to be my mom and dad.

882
00:58:23,794 --> 00:58:24,955
Look at her.

883
00:58:25,087 --> 00:58:28,580
She got so many jobs acting
in weddings last year.

884
00:58:30,092 --> 00:58:33,176
I even caught the bouquet
from a bitch I've never met.

885
00:58:33,429 --> 00:58:36,388
If you get the bouquet,
they pay an extra $10.

886
00:58:36,515 --> 00:58:38,632
That's how your acting got so good!

887
00:58:38,726 --> 00:58:44,097
Acting is one thing,
but this family is so gullible, right?

888
00:58:44,189 --> 00:58:46,397
The madame especially.

889
00:58:46,483 --> 00:58:48,099
You said it.

890
00:58:50,029 --> 00:58:53,238
She's so naive, and nice.

891
00:58:53,574 --> 00:58:55,657
She's rich, but still nice.

892
00:58:55,743 --> 00:58:57,951
Not "rich, but still nice."

893
00:59:0-2,120 --> 00:59:01,784
"Nice because she's rich."
You know?

894
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:08,788
Hell, if I had all this money.

895
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:13,751
I'd be nice too!

896
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:15,630
Even nicer!

897
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:18,008
That's true.
Your mom's right.

898
00:59:18,348 --> 00:59:20,590
Rich people are naive.
No resentments.

899
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:23,142
No creases on them.

900
00:59:23,228 --> 00:59:26,312
It all gets ironed out.
Money is an iron.

901
00:59:26,565 --> 00:59:29,057
Those creases all get smoothed out.

902
00:59:29,193 --> 00:59:30,434
Hey, Ki-woo.

903
00:59:31,278 --> 00:59:35,943
You know that driver, Yoon?
Was it Yoon?

904
00:59:36,617 --> 00:59:38,904
The driver before me.

905
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:40,405
Yeah, Yoon.

906
00:59:40,496 --> 00:59:45,082
He must be working somewhere else now,
right?

907
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:47,500
Sure, he must be.

908
00:59:47,586 --> 00:59:50,829
He's young, got a nice physique.

909
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:54,291
He must've found a better job.

910
00:59:54,384 --> 00:59:56,626
Fucking hell!

911
00:59:57,471 --> 01:00:0-1,633
What's with her now?

912
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:06,137
We're the ones who need help.
Worry about us, okay?

913
01:00:06,647 --> 01:00:09,856
Dad! Come on, Dad!

914
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:14,394
Just focus on us, okay?
On us!

915
01:00:14,613 --> 01:00:18,948
Not Driver Yoon, but me, please!

916
01:00:19,076 --> 01:00:21,159
Awesome timing, huh?

917
01:00:21,286 --> 01:00:25,030
She speaks,
and the lightning crashes!

918
01:00:27,126 --> 01:00:29,960
Hey, Jessica. Cheers.

919
01:00:30,838 --> 01:00:36,630
Hey, when I went up before,
and you were in the bath...

920
01:00:36,718 --> 01:00:38,300
What about it?

921
01:00:39,179 --> 01:00:42,343
How to put it?
You fit in here.

922
01:00:42,683 --> 01:00:45,596
This rich house suits you.
Not like us.

923
01:00:45,686 --> 01:00:46,602
Fuck off.

924
01:00:46,603 --> 01:00:47,521
I'm serious!

925
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:49,262
Dad, before...

926
01:00:49,356 --> 01:00:52,019
She was lying back in the tub,
watching TV.

927
01:00:52,568 --> 01:00:54,901
Like she's lived here for years.

928
01:00:56,864 --> 01:01:02,701
Speaking of which,
if this became our house,

929
01:01:02,828 --> 01:01:06,947
if we lived here,
which room would you want?

930
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:12,252
What room in this masterwork
by the great Namgoong?

931
01:01:12,462 --> 01:01:14,374
Fuck, I don't know.

932
01:01:14,464 --> 01:01:18,128
Get me the house first.
Then I'll think about it.

933
01:01:18,468 --> 01:01:20,710
We live here now, don't we?

934
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:24,969
Getting drunk in the living room.

935
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,138
Right, we live here.
Why not?

936
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:32,685
This is our home right now.
It's cosy.

937
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,813
Cosy? Are you feeling cosy?

938
01:01:36,028 --> 01:01:40,898
Sure, but suppose Park walked
through that door now.

939
01:01:41,491 --> 01:01:42,902
What about your dad?

940
01:01:43,035 --> 01:01:46,369
He'd run and hide like a cockroach.

941
01:01:46,872 --> 01:01:49,364
Kids, you know at our house,

942
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:55,045
when you turn on the light,
and the cockroaches scatter?

943
01:01:55,255 --> 01:01:56,996
You know what I mean?

944
01:01:57,633 --> 01:02:00,751
I'm getting fucking tired of this.

945
01:02:01,511 --> 01:02:03,343
- A cockroach?
- Yeah.

946
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,762
Huh? What's wrong?

947
01:02:08,852 --> 01:02:10,184
What's the matter?

948
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:13,854
Dad, don't do that.
You only live once.

949
01:02:21,156 --> 01:02:22,863
What the hell?

950
01:02:23,116 --> 01:02:24,652
I fooled you!
Didn't I?

951
01:02:24,743 --> 01:02:26,109
Jesus, Dad.

952
01:02:26,203 --> 01:02:30,368
I fooled you too, Ki-woo?
Did it look for real?

953
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:33,871
If it was for real,
I'd fucking kill you.

954
01:02:34,253 --> 01:02:37,872
What is this?
Fucking puppy.

955
01:02:43,637 --> 01:02:45,720
Who is it at this hour?

956
01:02:46,014 --> 01:02:47,596
What is it?

957
01:02:54,147 --> 01:02:55,479
What's she doing here?

958
01:02:55,691 --> 01:02:57,978
The old housekeeper?

959
01:03:0-2,694 --> 01:03:00,356
What's she here for?

960
01:03:00,904 --> 01:03:05,023
She won't stop ringing it.

961
01:03:05,909 --> 01:03:08,743
Raising a racket.

962
01:03:10,205 --> 01:03:11,205
Who is it?

963
01:03:11,206 --> 01:03:15,701
Oh, hello! I'm...

964
01:03:16,086 --> 01:03:17,748
The madame's not in, right?

965
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:18,838
What?

966
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:23,209
I worked here
for a very long time.

967
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,506
Above the monitor there,
you see a photo of 3 dogs, right?

968
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,010
Zoonie, Berry, Foofoo.

969
01:03:31,101 --> 01:03:35,391
I get it,
but why are you here?

970
01:03:35,647 --> 01:03:40,108
You're my successor
as housekeeper, right?

971
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,776
Anyway...

972
01:03:47,743 --> 01:03:50,861
I'm very sorry
to call on you so late.

973
01:03:51,121 --> 01:03:52,578
It's just that...

974
01:03:53,165 --> 01:04:00,165
I forgot something in the basement
under the kitchen.

975
01:04:00,714 --> 01:04:06,802
When I left, they pushed me out
so quickly...

976
01:04:10,307 --> 01:04:12,139
Would you let me in?

977
01:04:14,436 --> 01:04:16,098
What do we do?

978
01:04:16,938 --> 01:04:19,021
This isn't in the plan.

979
01:04:26,782 --> 01:04:28,569
Sorry for the trouble.

980
01:04:29,117 --> 01:04:30,153
This way.

981
01:04:30,243 --> 01:04:31,279
Yes, thank you.

982
01:04:33,663 --> 01:04:35,871
You can put your raincoat...

983
01:04:35,957 --> 01:04:38,119
It'll just be a second.

984
01:04:39,127 --> 01:04:42,620
Quite a meal there.
That'll be a job to clean up.

985
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:45,882
But what did you leave below?

986
01:04:50,597 --> 01:04:52,839
Want to come down with me?

987
01:04:54,309 --> 01:04:57,347
Well, just go ahead.

988
01:05:50,657 --> 01:05:53,741
Help me push this!

989
01:05:54,286 --> 01:05:56,778
Pull it! From over there.

990
01:05:56,872 --> 01:06:0-2,113
What?

991
01:06:0-2,373 --> 01:06:0-1,534
Pull!

992
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,576
Pull it hard!

993
01:06:07,507 --> 01:06:08,918
Are you okay?

994
01:06:10,218 --> 01:06:11,800
Did I scare you?

995
01:06:14,097 --> 01:06:15,554
Thank you!

996
01:06:16,933 --> 01:06:18,265
Thank you.

997
01:06:26,443 --> 01:06:27,443
Honey!

998
01:06:27,486 --> 01:06:28,943
What the hell?

999
01:06:29,988 --> 01:06:31,069
Hey!

1000
01:06:31,156 --> 01:06:32,488
Honey!

1001
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,032
Honey!

1002
01:06:37,704 --> 01:06:38,740
Wait!

1003
01:06:38,872 --> 01:06:40,989
Honey, I'm here!

1004
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:42,699
What is all this?

1005
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,001
Honey!

1006
01:06:46,338 --> 01:06:48,000
Honey, I'm fine.

1007
01:06:48,089 --> 01:06:49,796
No you're not!

1008
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:51,172
I'm fine, really.

1009
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:52,420
How can you say that?

1010
01:06:52,511 --> 01:06:54,252
But I'm really hungry.

1011
01:06:54,346 --> 01:06:55,346
Suck it!

1012
01:06:55,388 --> 01:07:0-2,381
How many days has it been?

1013
01:07:0-2,642 --> 01:07:00,349
You must've been so hungry!

1014
01:07:02,395 --> 01:07:03,681
It's okay.

1015
01:07:03,772 --> 01:07:06,515
She's a nice woman. She let me in.

1016
01:07:06,608 --> 01:07:08,645
There was an iron plate,
for grilling meat.

1017
01:07:08,735 --> 01:07:10,271
It was wedged under the shelf.

1018
01:07:10,362 --> 01:07:11,398
So that's why.

1019
01:07:11,488 --> 01:07:14,822
I couldn't open it
from the inside.

1020
01:07:15,075 --> 01:07:18,113
- What's going on here?
- I know you must be startled.

1021
01:07:18,662 --> 01:07:21,029
I would be too in this situation.

1022
01:07:21,206 --> 01:07:25,951
But as two fellow workers...
Right, Chung-sook?

1023
01:07:26,044 --> 01:07:28,832
How do you know my name?

1024
01:07:29,339 --> 01:07:33,959
To be honest I'm still texting
with the boy Da-song.

1025
01:07:34,177 --> 01:07:38,717
I knew they were going camping,
so I came today.

1026
01:07:38,848 --> 01:07:41,465
I wanted to speak to you alone.

1027
01:07:41,726 --> 01:07:43,092
<i>Talking about.</i>

1028
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:47,643
Don't worry, Chung-sook.

1029
01:07:47,816 --> 01:07:51,230
I cut the wire
on the CCTV by the gate.

1030
01:07:51,611 --> 01:07:55,321
Nobody knows I came.
Isn't that good, sis?

1031
01:07:55,407 --> 01:07:57,444
Don't call me sis!

1032
01:07:57,534 --> 01:08:00,447
Sis, my name is Moon-gwang.

1033
01:08:00,704 --> 01:08:05,074
This is my hubbie Oh Geun-sae.
Say hello, honey.

1034
01:08:05,166 --> 01:08:08,534
This tastes great.
What happened to your face?

1035
01:08:08,628 --> 01:08:11,917
I'll tell you later.

1036
01:08:12,007 --> 01:08:15,967
So you'd steal food every day
while working in the kitchen.

1037
01:08:16,052 --> 01:08:17,293
Feeding your husband.

1038
01:08:17,387 --> 01:08:21,722
Not at all! I bought all his food
with my salary.

1039
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:24,888
That's so unfair!

1040
01:08:25,103 --> 01:08:27,641
But how long has
your husband been down here?

1041
01:08:27,731 --> 01:08:30,189
Hold on a sec.
4 years?

1042
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:33,852
4 years, 3 months and 17 days.

1043
01:08:33,945 --> 01:08:35,777
Right, it's June now.

1044
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:42,110
Four years ago
when Mr. Namgoong moved to Paris,

1045
01:08:42,412 --> 01:08:45,075
in the time before Mr. Park's family
moved in,

1046
01:08:45,624 --> 01:08:49,117
I brought my husband down here.

1047
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:54,046
Many rich houses have secret bunkers,
where you can hide

1048
01:08:54,215 --> 01:09:0-2,835
in case North Korea attacks,
or if creditors break in.

1049
01:09:0-2,970 --> 01:09:04,932
But it seems Mr. Namgoong was
a bit embarrassed about this,

1050
01:09:05,143 --> 01:09:08,887
because he never mentioned it
to Mr. Park's family.

1051
01:09:09,064 --> 01:09:10,521
So only I know about it.

1052
01:09:10,607 --> 01:09:12,894
So that's how it happened.

1053
01:09:13,193 --> 01:09:17,403
But now that I know, I've no choice
but to call the police!

1054
01:09:17,489 --> 01:09:19,321
No please, sis!

1055
01:09:19,699 --> 01:09:22,737
As fellow members of the needy,
please don't.

1056
01:09:22,827 --> 01:09:24,318
I'm not needy!

1057
01:09:24,412 --> 01:09:28,122
But we're needy!

1058
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:32,452
We've no house, no money,
only debts!

1059
01:09:32,712 --> 01:09:33,953
Sis, please!

1060
01:09:34,047 --> 01:09:38,508
Even after 4 years of hiding,
those debt collectors won't give up.

1061
01:09:38,593 --> 01:09:42,803
They're still searching for him,
threatening to stab him.

1062
01:09:42,889 --> 01:09:44,425
You used loan sharks?

1063
01:09:45,308 --> 01:09:47,174
It's all my fault.

1064
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:49,260
The Taiwan cake shop.

1065
01:09:49,604 --> 01:09:53,644
My Taiwanese Wangshui
castella shop went bust.

1066
01:09:53,775 --> 01:09:55,858
I was overwhelmed by debt.

1067
01:09:56,027 --> 01:09:57,609
Please take this.

1068
01:09:57,946 --> 01:10:0-1,403
What's that?

1069
01:10:0-1,572 --> 01:10:03,737
It's not much,
just a modest sum.

1070
01:10:03,827 --> 01:10:06,490
But we'll send it
to you every month.

1071
01:10:07,038 --> 01:10:08,870
In return,
just once every 2 days,

1072
01:10:08,957 --> 01:10:11,950
please leave him some food.

1073
01:10:12,711 --> 01:10:15,624
No no, just once a week.

1074
01:10:16,172 --> 01:10:18,414
There's a refrigerator here.
Just once a week.

1075
01:10:18,508 --> 01:10:21,626
You've got some nerve!
I'm calling the police.

1076
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:22,720
Sis!

1077
01:10:25,056 --> 01:10:26,342
Who is that?

1078
01:10:29,477 --> 01:10:31,139
Wait... Jessica?

1079
01:10:31,938 --> 01:10:33,099
Mr. Kim?

1080
01:10:33,189 --> 01:10:34,270
What the hell?

1081
01:10:35,608 --> 01:10:36,849
Dad, my ankle!

1082
01:10:36,943 --> 01:10:38,059
You okay?
Sorry.

1083
01:10:38,153 --> 01:10:40,236
Dad, my foot.

1084
01:10:40,321 --> 01:10:42,108
Don't call me Dad!

1085
01:10:49,122 --> 01:10:53,036
I thought it was weird
when the driver was fired.

1086
01:10:53,918 --> 01:10:54,626
Hey!

1087
01:10:54,627 --> 01:10:56,994
- Let's talk things over.
- What the hell?

1088
01:10:57,088 --> 01:11:0-2,499
Are you some family of charlatans?

1089
01:11:0-2,590 --> 01:11:0-1,548
So, sis...

1090
01:11:0-1,549 --> 01:11:01,836
Don't fucking call me sis,
you filthy bitch!

1091
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:07,301
I'm gonna send this video
to the madame, how about that?

1092
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:09,347
<i>Dad, my foot.</i>

1093
01:11:09,559 --> 01:11:11,767
No reception in the basement,
right?

1094
01:11:12,437 --> 01:11:14,303
- The phone works fine.
- Fuck.

1095
01:11:14,397 --> 01:11:19,108
Ma'am, to be honest,
the jobs we have here...

1096
01:11:19,194 --> 01:11:22,107
Shut up!
It's too late now!

1097
01:11:22,197 --> 01:11:25,531
Let's all go to jail!
We're fucking going down!

1098
01:11:25,617 --> 01:11:28,530
Lady, are you crazy?

1099
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:34,240
If they see that video, Mr. Park
and his wife will be so shocked!

1100
01:11:34,626 --> 01:11:37,790
What did those nice people
ever do wrong?

1101
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:39,630
Why do this to them?

1102
01:11:39,672 --> 01:11:40,879
Stop right there!

1103
01:11:41,257 --> 01:11:43,374
Or I'll push the 'send' button.

1104
01:11:43,802 --> 01:11:45,168
Follow me.

1105
01:11:45,929 --> 01:11:48,342
Calm down, ma'am.

1106
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:53,933
Don't push!

1107
01:11:55,188 --> 01:11:56,770
Let's go up, honey.

1108
01:11:57,190 --> 01:12:0-1,853
Time for you to get some fresh air!

1109
01:12:17,168 --> 01:12:23,165
Honey, this 'send' button is
like a missile launcher.

1110
01:12:23,758 --> 01:12:25,545
What do you mean, honey?

1111
01:12:26,177 --> 01:12:31,297
If we threaten to push it,
those people can't do anything.

1112
01:12:31,432 --> 01:12:35,767
It's like a North Korean rocket.
A North Korean missile button!

1113
01:12:37,188 --> 01:12:40,932
Today our beloved
Great Leader Kim Jong-un,

1114
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:44,151
after witnessing
the charlatan family video,

1115
01:12:44,237 --> 01:12:46,900
was unable to contain
his shock and fury

1116
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:50,154
at their wicked,
despicable provocation!

1117
01:12:50,243 --> 01:12:52,200
I've missed your jokes, honey!

1118
01:12:52,287 --> 01:12:56,827
Therefore our Great Leader,
in this age of denuclearization,

1119
01:12:56,916 --> 01:13:02,662
has commanded that the nation's
last remaining nuclear warhead

1120
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:05,293
be driven down the throats
of this wicked family!

1121
01:13:05,383 --> 01:13:10,048
No one can imitate North Korean
news anchors like you!

1122
01:13:10,138 --> 01:13:15,384
With their stinking guts serving
as the last nuclear graveyard,

1123
01:13:15,476 --> 01:13:20,141
our Dear Leader's wish to denuclearize
and bring world peace can...

1124
01:13:20,231 --> 01:13:22,018
Hands in the air, fuckers!

1125
01:13:22,442 --> 01:13:23,853
Higher!

1126
01:13:25,778 --> 01:13:27,815
You scumbag family.

1127
01:13:27,906 --> 01:13:29,022
Husband?

1128
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,032
Husband.

1129
01:13:30,033 --> 01:13:30,991
Wife?

1130
01:13:30,992 --> 01:13:31,867
Yes.

1131
01:13:31,868 --> 01:13:33,530
- Son?
- Yes.

1132
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:34,861
- Daughter?
- Daughter.

1133
01:13:34,954 --> 01:13:36,741
You neanderthals.

1134
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:41,125
Is that all you can think to do,
drink yourselves stupid?

1135
01:13:41,502 --> 01:13:46,543
In this home suffused
with Mr. Namgoong's creative spirit?

1136
01:13:46,799 --> 01:13:47,880
You cretins!

1137
01:13:47,967 --> 01:13:49,333
What do you know about art?

1138
01:13:49,427 --> 01:13:51,544
What would they know?

1139
01:13:52,347 --> 01:14:0-1,347
When the sun was nice,
we'd bask in those sunbeams, right?

1140
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:05,270
At such moments we could feel
his artistic touch.

1141
01:14:53,032 --> 01:14:56,366
Give it to me!

1142
01:15:15,555 --> 01:15:19,299
Good job!
Delete it!

1143
01:15:20,143 --> 01:15:23,136
Careful, don't send it by accident.

1144
01:15:37,577 --> 01:15:38,863
Hello?

1145
01:15:39,328 --> 01:15:42,992
Listen, do you know
how to make ram-don?

1146
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:44,665
Ram-don?

1147
01:15:44,751 --> 01:15:48,165
Da-song likes ram-don
more than anything.

1148
01:15:48,546 --> 01:15:51,960
If you boil the water now,
the timing will be perfect.

1149
01:15:52,383 --> 01:15:55,091
<i>There's sirloin in the fridge,
add that too.</i>

1150
01:15:55,178 --> 01:15:56,794
Then, the camping...?

1151
01:15:56,888 --> 01:16:00,347
<i>My god, what a disaster.</i>

1152
01:16:01,017 --> 01:16:06,183
The river overflowed and
everyone was packing their tents,

1153
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:09,352
but Da-song was crying
and refusing to go home.

1154
01:16:09,567 --> 01:16:13,436
<i>Anyway, ram-don as soon
as we walk in, okay?</i>

1155
01:16:13,905 --> 01:16:16,238
Then you're almost here?

1156
01:16:16,365 --> 01:16:18,823
8 minutes, according to the GPS.

1157
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,408
You arrive in 8 minutes...

1158
01:16:20,495 --> 01:16:23,988
<i>Start boiling
the water right away!</i>

1159
01:16:28,169 --> 01:16:29,876
What the hell is ram-don?

1160
01:16:38,888 --> 01:16:40,550
Move, quickly!

1161
01:16:41,641 --> 01:16:43,348
Hurry!

1162
01:16:50,274 --> 01:16:52,061
<i>Ramen / Udon</i>

1163
01:16:53,945 --> 01:16:56,653
Dad, I can't drag her any further!

1164
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:09,533
What are you doing?

1165
01:17:11,087 --> 01:17:12,544
Dad!

1166
01:17:15,883 --> 01:17:18,796
Go up quickly!
Help upstairs.

1167
01:17:26,644 --> 01:17:27,885
Take this!

1168
01:17:47,123 --> 01:17:48,330
Welcome home!

1169
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:51,784
Da-song, look!
Let's eat ram-don!

1170
01:17:53,838 --> 01:17:55,170
<i>Da-song!</i>

1171
01:18:0-2,134 --> 01:18:00,000
<i>Da-song!</i>

1172
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:07,807
Madame!

1173
01:18:26,162 --> 01:18:28,404
Why don't you
just eat the ram-don?

1174
01:18:28,497 --> 01:18:29,414
Shall I?

1175
01:18:29,415 --> 01:18:32,453
No wait. I can give it
to my husband.

1176
01:18:32,543 --> 01:18:34,455
There's sirloin in here.

1177
01:18:37,006 --> 01:18:40,670
It's cooked through?
Medium well done.

1178
01:19:05,868 --> 01:19:11,705
<i>Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!</i>

1179
01:19:11,874 --> 01:19:18,041
<i>Home from the office,
Mr. Park is off duty now.</i>

1180
01:19:20,132 --> 01:19:24,422
<i>Returning after a day's work...
I love you so much, Mr. Park!</i>

1181
01:19:24,512 --> 01:19:26,424
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

1182
01:19:37,984 --> 01:19:40,351
Honey, do you want some ram-don?

1183
01:19:40,611 --> 01:19:41,647
Da-song doesn't want it?

1184
01:19:41,737 --> 01:19:42,445
No.

1185
01:19:42,446 --> 01:19:44,483
No, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

1186
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:47,483
Why are you staring?

1187
01:19:48,703 --> 01:19:52,242
Mr. Park, you feed me
and house me.

1188
01:19:52,331 --> 01:19:53,663
<i>Respect!</i>

1189
01:19:55,751 --> 01:19:57,492
You do this every day?

1190
01:20:0-2,045 --> 01:20:03,336
Sure, I even send whole sentences
to thank him.

1191
01:20:03,926 --> 01:20:06,168
Someone of your age should know it.

1192
01:20:06,262 --> 01:20:07,262
Know what?

1193
01:20:07,305 --> 01:20:08,921
Morse Code.

1194
01:20:09,598 --> 01:20:13,342
That sensor's going batty.

1195
01:20:21,819 --> 01:20:25,153
Da-song will know it,
since he's a Scout.

1196
01:20:25,406 --> 01:20:26,863
It's ridiculous, right?

1197
01:20:27,241 --> 01:20:30,484
Running around,
trying to please a kid.

1198
01:20:30,786 --> 01:20:32,618
He's not some kind of prince.

1199
01:20:32,872 --> 01:20:35,330
He's the youngest. It's common.

1200
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:38,161
Please understand.

1201
01:20:38,669 --> 01:20:42,162
Da-song is a bit... unwell.

1202
01:20:42,715 --> 01:20:45,503
He's receiving trauma therapy
and art therapy.

1203
01:20:46,677 --> 01:20:48,634
There was an incident.

1204
01:20:48,763 --> 01:20:50,129
What incident?

1205
01:20:50,556 --> 01:20:53,845
Sis, you believe in ghosts, too?

1206
01:20:55,519 --> 01:21:0-1,012
Da-song saw a ghost in the house
when he was in 1st grade.

1207
01:21:05,613 --> 01:21:08,196
He had a birthday party
at home that day.

1208
01:21:08,491 --> 01:21:10,949
Late that night,
when everyone was sleeping,

1209
01:21:11,035 --> 01:21:15,279
Da-song crept down to the kitchen
and took the cake out.

1210
01:21:15,706 --> 01:21:18,619
The whipped cream
on that cake was amazing.

1211
01:21:18,834 --> 01:21:21,417
Even in bed, he couldn't stop
thinking about it.

1212
01:21:22,046 --> 01:21:27,417
So Da-song was sitting,
eating his cake...

1213
01:21:37,144 --> 01:21:40,057
He screamed,
and I ran downstairs,

1214
01:21:40,689 --> 01:21:42,476
and he was all...

1215
01:21:43,192 --> 01:21:48,358
his eyes rolled back in his head,
convulsions, foam in his mouth.

1216
01:21:50,533 --> 01:21:52,820
Have you ever seen
a child have a seizure?

1217
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:53,828
No.

1218
01:21:53,829 --> 01:22:0-2,789
They need 15-minute treatment,
or they're done for.

1219
01:22:0-1,083 --> 01:22:03,373
That's the time you have to reach
an emergency room, 15 minutes.

1220
01:22:04,547 --> 01:22:10,009
How can you live
in a place like this?

1221
01:22:10,136 --> 01:22:13,174
Well, lots of people
live underground.

1222
01:22:13,431 --> 01:22:15,297
Especially if you count
semi-basements.

1223
01:22:15,391 --> 01:22:19,681
What'll you do?
You don't have a plan?

1224
01:22:20,229 --> 01:22:23,472
I just feel comfortable here.

1225
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,688
It feels like I was born here.

1226
01:22:28,737 --> 01:22:31,730
Maybe I had my wedding here, too.

1227
01:22:32,199 --> 01:22:35,158
As for the National Pension,
I don't qualify.

1228
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:39,954
In my old age,
love will comfort me.

1229
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:46,791
So please.
Let me live down here.

1230
01:22:48,757 --> 01:22:50,089
Anyway...

1231
01:22:51,051 --> 01:22:55,967
My husband was away on business,
so I had to deal with it all.

1232
01:22:56,724 --> 01:23:00,934
Since then we've always
gone out for his birthday.

1233
01:23:01,228 --> 01:23:03,766
Last year my mother's house,
this year, camping.

1234
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:09,026
Da-song's dad says it's just
a part of growing up.

1235
01:23:09,236 --> 01:23:13,776
They say a ghost
in the house brings wealth.

1236
01:23:15,159 --> 01:23:19,779
Actually, the money's been
good recently.

1237
01:23:46,774 --> 01:23:48,356
Thank god.

1238
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:17,878
Just stay here for now.

1239
01:24:28,732 --> 01:24:30,598
Zoonie, what's wrong?

1240
01:24:33,237 --> 01:24:34,773
Something under there?

1241
01:24:36,031 --> 01:24:37,488
What is it?

1242
01:24:38,701 --> 01:24:40,033
Damn it!

1243
01:24:41,412 --> 01:24:42,573
- Mom!
- Yeah?

1244
01:24:42,663 --> 01:24:45,030
- How could you?
- What?

1245
01:24:45,124 --> 01:24:49,209
I like ram-don too!
How could you not even ask me?

1246
01:24:49,545 --> 01:24:50,421
Well...

1247
01:24:50,422 --> 01:24:54,210
Da-song didn't want it, so you asked Dad,
then ate it yourself.

1248
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,300
Want her to make one?

1249
01:24:55,342 --> 01:24:57,208
That's not the point!

1250
01:24:57,303 --> 01:25:00,637
- Stop fighting over ramen!
- Why didn't you ask me?

1251
01:25:01,098 --> 01:25:03,715
Oh, stop it! Just go to bed.
Go get changed.

1252
01:25:08,105 --> 01:25:09,471
This way!

1253
01:25:11,609 --> 01:25:12,609
And Ki-jung?

1254
01:25:12,693 --> 01:25:15,060
Under there! Hurry!

1255
01:25:17,406 --> 01:25:20,990
One, two, three! One, two three!

1256
01:25:21,076 --> 01:25:22,362
Da-song?

1257
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:24,906
Da-song, cut it out!

1258
01:25:25,414 --> 01:25:28,157
He's gone crazy!
Get an umbrella.

1259
01:25:28,459 --> 01:25:29,995
Hey Park Da-song!

1260
01:25:31,503 --> 01:25:35,713
What a monster.
What the hell is he doing?

1261
01:25:36,425 --> 01:25:40,169
Da-song, it's time for bed!
You know how late it is?

1262
01:25:40,262 --> 01:25:41,423
Here.

1263
01:25:42,264 --> 01:25:43,721
Honey, here.

1264
01:25:48,687 --> 01:25:53,728
Who do you take after to be so stubborn!
Look at this rain!

1265
01:26:0-1,156 --> 01:26:01,864
<i>OMG Kevin. Da-song camping
in the yard.</i>

1266
01:26:05,829 --> 01:26:10,119
Hey, channel 3 for emergencies!
Keep it turned on.

1267
01:26:10,751 --> 01:26:13,494
Let me have it.
I can't believe him.

1268
01:26:14,088 --> 01:26:16,671
Just leave him.
He'll come in if he's tired.

1269
01:26:16,882 --> 01:26:19,670
<i>- I want you here, honey.
- I'm with you.</i>

1270
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,001
Hey, Da-hye!

1271
01:26:21,095 --> 01:26:23,553
Stop using your phone.
Go to bed.

1272
01:26:23,972 --> 01:26:26,510
Go sleep in your room.
We'll take care of things.

1273
01:26:26,642 --> 01:26:29,931
This is the living room,
do you copy?

1274
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,101
<i>Copy, over.</i>

1275
01:26:31,188 --> 01:26:35,148
Daddy is standing by
for emergencies, over.

1276
01:26:35,275 --> 01:26:37,767
<i>Got it, over.</i>

1277
01:26:39,113 --> 01:26:41,150
Is that tent going to leak?

1278
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:44,483
We ordered from the U.S.,
it'll be fine.

1279
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:47,619
- Should we sleep here?
- What?

1280
01:26:47,746 --> 01:26:49,954
We've got a full view of the tent.

1281
01:26:50,082 --> 01:26:51,948
Good idea.
I'll feel much better.

1282
01:26:52,042 --> 01:26:52,834
Right?

1283
01:26:52,835 --> 01:26:54,827
Let's watch over him as we sleep.

1284
01:26:56,964 --> 01:27:0-2,455
What a kid...

1285
01:27:07,683 --> 01:27:09,049
Wait a minute.

1286
01:27:11,478 --> 01:27:13,640
Where's that smell coming from?

1287
01:27:13,731 --> 01:27:15,017
What smell?

1288
01:27:15,315 --> 01:27:16,772
Mr. Kim's smell.

1289
01:27:17,234 --> 01:27:18,770
- Mr. Kim?
- Yeah.

1290
01:27:19,570 --> 01:27:20,936
Not sure what you mean.

1291
01:27:21,029 --> 01:27:23,988
Really?
You must have smelled it.

1292
01:27:24,366 --> 01:27:28,326
That smell that wafts through the car,
how to describe it?

1293
01:27:28,412 --> 01:27:31,155
- An old man's smell?
- No no, it's not that.

1294
01:27:31,248 --> 01:27:32,955
What is it?

1295
01:27:33,584 --> 01:27:35,576
Like an old radish?

1296
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:37,251
No.

1297
01:27:37,546 --> 01:27:39,788
You know when you boil a rag?

1298
01:27:39,882 --> 01:27:41,293
It smells like that.

1299
01:27:43,802 --> 01:27:50,174
Anyway, even though he always seems
about to cross the line,

1300
01:27:50,267 --> 01:27:53,351
he never does cross it.
That's good.

1301
01:27:53,562 --> 01:27:55,269
- I'll give him credit.
- Yeah.

1302
01:27:56,398 --> 01:28:0-2,685
But that smell crosses the line.

1303
01:28:0-1,276 --> 01:28:01,563
It powers through right
into the back seat.

1304
01:28:01,945 --> 01:28:03,686
How bad can it be?

1305
01:28:03,781 --> 01:28:05,022
I don't know.

1306
01:28:05,741 --> 01:28:08,233
It's hard to describe.

1307
01:28:09,244 --> 01:28:12,863
But you sometimes smell it
on the subway.

1308
01:28:12,998 --> 01:28:16,241
It's been ages
since I rode a subway.

1309
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,919
People who ride the subway
have a special smell.

1310
01:28:20,005 --> 01:28:21,212
Yeah.

1311
01:28:37,564 --> 01:28:40,147
Isn't this like the car's back seat?

1312
01:28:40,734 --> 01:28:44,523
What if Da-song comes back in?

1313
01:28:45,155 --> 01:28:46,646
Don't worry!

1314
01:28:47,241 --> 01:28:49,904
I can just pull my hand back.

1315
01:28:55,541 --> 01:28:57,032
We shouldn't...

1316
01:29:03,131 --> 01:29:04,793
Do it clockwise.

1317
01:29:05,509 --> 01:29:06,670
Right.

1318
01:29:10,055 --> 01:29:12,843
You know where.

1319
01:29:29,741 --> 01:29:33,405
You still have those cheap panties?

1320
01:29:33,829 --> 01:29:34,865
Huh?

1321
01:29:34,997 --> 01:29:37,785
The ones Yoon's girlfriend left behind.

1322
01:29:38,917 --> 01:29:41,910
If you wear those,
I'll get really fucking hard.

1323
01:29:42,671 --> 01:29:44,003
Really?

1324
01:29:44,464 --> 01:29:47,002
Then buy me drugs.

1325
01:29:48,051 --> 01:29:50,794
Buy me drugs!

1326
01:29:52,681 --> 01:29:54,263
Eat this instead.

1327
01:30:06,111 --> 01:30:07,647
You like it?

1328
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:30,417
<i>They're passed out cold.
Sneak out now.</i>

1329
01:31:04,586 --> 01:31:07,044
<i>Emergency! Emergency, over!</i>

1330
01:31:09,341 --> 01:31:10,923
<i>- Emergency!</i>
- What?

1331
01:31:11,843 --> 01:31:13,084
What is it, over!

1332
01:31:13,303 --> 01:31:14,464
Da-song, what's wrong?

1333
01:31:15,013 --> 01:31:17,096
<i>I can't sleep, over.</i>

1334
01:31:17,516 --> 01:31:21,226
So stop it and come in, okay?

1335
01:31:21,561 --> 01:31:24,099
Go sleep in your soft bed, over.

1336
01:31:24,272 --> 01:31:25,558
Right!

1337
01:31:25,774 --> 01:31:27,857
<i>I don't want to, over.</i>

1338
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:29,817
Hey, Park Da-song.

1339
01:31:34,783 --> 01:31:36,615
Let's just sleep...

1340
01:33:12,172 --> 01:33:15,711
How did it turn out back there?

1341
01:33:16,676 --> 01:33:17,917
What?

1342
01:33:20,097 --> 01:33:22,214
The people in the basement.

1343
01:33:25,102 --> 01:33:29,267
Well, I tied them up.

1344
01:33:29,606 --> 01:33:31,563
What will we do now?

1345
01:33:33,026 --> 01:33:34,267
Huh?

1346
01:33:36,404 --> 01:33:39,568
What do we do now,
what's our plan?

1347
01:33:40,575 --> 01:33:43,409
I've been wondering...

1348
01:33:44,287 --> 01:33:47,451
What would Min do
in this situation?

1349
01:33:49,167 --> 01:33:51,955
Min wouldn't be
in this situation!

1350
01:33:53,505 --> 01:34:0-1,172
Look kids, we made it
out of there safely, right?

1351
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:05,556
And besides us, nobody knows
what happened there. Right?

1352
01:34:05,976 --> 01:34:08,434
So nothing happened.
You understand?

1353
01:34:09,855 --> 01:34:14,225
I've got my own plan.

1354
01:34:14,818 --> 01:34:17,686
So you two just forget
about it, okay?

1355
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:21,022
Let's go home.

1356
01:34:21,616 --> 01:34:23,573
Let's go take a bath.

1357
01:34:42,512 --> 01:34:44,879
What are you doing there?
Hurry up!

1358
01:35:0-1,321 --> 01:35:01,062
What's going on?

1359
01:35:02,866 --> 01:35:05,574
You stay there.
This is all sewage water.

1360
01:35:05,744 --> 01:35:08,578
Was our window open?

1361
01:35:12,626 --> 01:35:15,710
Help me out, Ki-taek!

1362
01:35:23,929 --> 01:35:25,295
Ki-woo!

1363
01:35:27,599 --> 01:35:30,387
Hey Ki-woo, close the window!

1364
01:35:32,354 --> 01:35:33,640
You got shocked?

1365
01:35:40,528 --> 01:35:42,019
I'm dizzy.

1366
01:35:45,909 --> 01:35:49,573
Hold on a sec.
Wait.

1367
01:35:55,377 --> 01:35:57,084
Shit, I'm dizzy.

1368
01:36:01,299 --> 01:36:03,586
Ki-jung, be careful.

1369
01:36:05,303 --> 01:36:07,090
Don't touch anything.

1370
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:24,896
Honey, I've got a concussion.

1371
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:27,690
I can't see you.

1372
01:36:49,139 --> 01:36:53,554
Honey, that woman Chung-sook...

1373
01:36:54,436 --> 01:36:56,348
Oh, god.

1374
01:36:56,521 --> 01:37:0-2,513
What a nice person.

1375
01:37:00,358 --> 01:37:03,351
She kicked me down the stairs.

1376
01:37:05,947 --> 01:37:07,939
Repeat after me.

1377
01:37:08,742 --> 01:37:10,904
Chung-sook...

1378
01:37:12,871 --> 01:37:15,784
Chung-sook...

1379
01:37:25,467 --> 01:37:27,333
Hey, Ki-woo!

1380
01:37:28,636 --> 01:37:30,172
What are you doing there?

1381
01:37:30,263 --> 01:37:31,504
Huh?

1382
01:37:46,237 --> 01:37:50,106
<i>h o l p... M...</i>

1383
01:38:55,765 --> 01:38:56,926
Dad.

1384
01:38:57,559 --> 01:39:0-2,720
Yeah?

1385
01:39:0-1,811 --> 01:39:03,304
What was your plan?

1386
01:39:05,233 --> 01:39:07,020
What are you talking about?

1387
01:39:08,153 --> 01:39:10,736
Before, you said you had a plan.

1388
01:39:11,114 --> 01:39:13,276
What will you do?
About...

1389
01:39:14,075 --> 01:39:15,361
the basement.

1390
01:39:16,077 --> 01:39:21,823
Ki-woo, you know
what kind of plan never fails?

1391
01:39:23,710 --> 01:39:25,952
No plan at all.

1392
01:39:26,296 --> 01:39:27,753
<i>No plan.</i>

1393
01:39:28,506 --> 01:39:29,963
You know why?

1394
01:39:31,801 --> 01:39:38,173
If you make a plan,
life never works out that way.

1395
01:39:39,142 --> 01:39:40,724
Look around us.

1396
01:39:41,144 --> 01:39:46,560
Did these people think,
"Let's all spend the night in a gym?"

1397
01:39:47,484 --> 01:39:49,100
But look now.

1398
01:39:49,569 --> 01:39:53,188
Everyone's sleeping on the floor,
us included.

1399
01:39:55,116 --> 01:40:0-2,154
That's why people shouldn't make plans.

1400
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:04,165
With no plan,
nothing can go wrong.

1401
01:40:04,459 --> 01:40:10,956
And if something spins out of control,
it doesn't matter.

1402
01:40:12,217 --> 01:40:14,960
Whether you kill someone,
or betray your country.

1403
01:40:16,596 --> 01:40:20,180
None of it fucking matters.
Got it?

1404
01:40:22,227 --> 01:40:23,559
Dad.

1405
01:40:25,647 --> 01:40:27,013
I'm sorry.

1406
01:40:27,857 --> 01:40:29,314
For what?

1407
01:40:32,654 --> 01:40:34,020
Everything.

1408
01:40:35,073 --> 01:40:36,484
All of it.

1409
01:40:38,826 --> 01:40:40,533
I'll take care of everything.

1410
01:40:41,746 --> 01:40:43,578
What are you talking about?

1411
01:40:45,917 --> 01:40:48,284
Why are you hugging that stone?

1412
01:40:49,254 --> 01:40:50,586
This?

1413
01:40:56,344 --> 01:41:0-1,178
It keeps clinging to me.

1414
01:41:03,851 --> 01:41:05,843
I think you need some sleep.

1415
01:41:08,731 --> 01:41:10,188
I'm serious.

1416
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:14,193
It keeps following me.

1417
01:41:26,874 --> 01:41:29,582
Miss Jessica! Sorry to call
on Sunday morning.

1418
01:41:29,794 --> 01:41:32,081
Are you free for lunch today?

1419
01:41:32,171 --> 01:41:36,006
<i>We're having a birthday impromptu
for Da-song.</i>

1420
01:41:37,552 --> 01:41:39,293
A birthday party?

1421
01:41:39,387 --> 01:41:42,596
If you come too,
Da-song will be so happy.

1422
01:41:43,057 --> 01:41:46,767
And have as much pasta, gratin,
and salmon steak as you want.

1423
01:41:47,228 --> 01:41:49,311
<i>Please come by 1PM,</i>

1424
01:41:49,397 --> 01:41:52,356
and I'll count today
as one of your lessons.

1425
01:41:52,442 --> 01:41:55,105
You know what I mean?
See you soon!

1426
01:41:56,446 --> 01:41:57,903
- Mom.
- Yeah?

1427
01:41:57,989 --> 01:42:01,608
For the impromptu,
should we invite Kevin too?

1428
01:42:01,701 --> 01:42:04,409
Great idea! Why not?
Will you call him?

1429
01:42:04,621 --> 01:42:08,410
Get some more sleep, honey!
You must be tired after yesterday.

1430
01:42:08,625 --> 01:42:12,619
If we have a party,
won't you need to do the rounds?

1431
01:42:12,795 --> 01:42:16,960
Right, the wine shop,
supermarket, bakery, florist...

1432
01:42:17,175 --> 01:42:20,543
But I already told Mr. Kim
to hurry over.

1433
01:42:20,887 --> 01:42:22,298
I'll pay him overtime.

1434
01:42:22,388 --> 01:42:23,388
Perfect

1435
01:42:33,816 --> 01:42:37,981
Everyone sit down,
I'll explain!

1436
01:42:38,071 --> 01:42:41,235
<i>Da-hye: We're having a party,</i>

1437
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:43,482
<i>and mom said to invite you!</i>

1438
01:42:45,787 --> 01:42:48,780
<i>Sis, in the basement...</i>

1439
01:42:49,165 --> 01:42:51,498
we have 10 outdoor tables.

1440
01:42:51,584 --> 01:42:55,419
First take them all out,
then arrange them...

1441
01:42:56,089 --> 01:43:0-1,173
No, come to the window.
I need to show you.

1442
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:02,842
With Da-song's tent
in the middle,

1443
01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:06,338
curve the tables outward...

1444
01:43:06,766 --> 01:43:08,507
A crane's wing formation!

1445
01:43:08,893 --> 01:43:12,011
Like Admiral Yi used, you know?
The Battle of Hansan Island!

1446
01:43:12,438 --> 01:43:14,771
Think of the tent
as the Japanese warship.

1447
01:43:14,857 --> 01:43:20,148
And our tables will make
a semicircular crane's wing formation.

1448
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:24,403
Then near the tent will be
the barbeque grill, firewood and such.

1449
01:43:24,492 --> 01:43:26,484
Arrange them all there!

1450
01:43:27,078 --> 01:43:30,446
Oh sure, bring your husband too!

1451
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:31,540
Yeah.

1452
01:43:31,624 --> 01:43:35,208
And definitely no presents,
just come!

1453
01:43:35,294 --> 01:43:36,086
Yeah.

1454
01:43:36,087 --> 01:43:38,124
What dress code?

1455
01:43:38,214 --> 01:43:41,548
It's an impromptu.
You can wear sweat pants!

1456
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:48,590
And definitely no presents!
Just come and eat hors d'oeuvres!

1457
01:43:49,684 --> 01:43:51,641
You know my culinary skills!

1458
01:43:51,894 --> 01:43:56,605
Right! We'll get drunk
in the daytime.

1459
01:43:57,066 --> 01:44:0-2,066
Yeah.

1460
01:44:0-2,151 --> 01:44:01,986
If you'd sing, that'd be grand!
You know the one...

1461
01:44:17,795 --> 01:44:20,663
Quiet, he's sleeping!

1462
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:24,299
Today the sky's so blue,
and no pollution!

1463
01:44:24,635 --> 01:44:26,672
Thanks to all the rain yesterday.

1464
01:44:27,847 --> 01:44:28,963
Right.

1465
01:44:29,182 --> 01:44:32,971
So we traded camping
for a garden party.

1466
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:35,681
Lemons into lemonade.

1467
01:44:39,066 --> 01:44:43,857
Right, that rain was such
a blessing!

1468
01:44:45,448 --> 01:44:49,909
And definitely no presents,
I mean it!

1469
01:44:50,661 --> 01:44:54,280
Right, just squeeze
your Mini Cooper into the garage.

1470
01:44:54,373 --> 01:44:55,955
Go on up!

1471
01:44:56,083 --> 01:45:01,203
Right, back it in.
Just don't block the Benz!

1472
01:45:01,297 --> 01:45:05,541
You're here!
It's been so long!

1473
01:45:06,636 --> 01:45:09,128
I told you no presents!

1474
01:45:27,532 --> 01:45:29,364
You were thinking of something else.

1475
01:45:29,867 --> 01:45:31,108
What?

1476
01:45:32,078 --> 01:45:35,537
While kissing me,
you thought of something else.

1477
01:45:37,583 --> 01:45:38,699
No.

1478
01:45:39,585 --> 01:45:43,078
What do you mean?
You're doing it now, too.

1479
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:47,041
Wow.

1480
01:45:48,928 --> 01:45:51,215
Everyone looks gorgeous, right?

1481
01:45:52,807 --> 01:45:56,471
Even for a sudden gathering,
they're so cool.

1482
01:45:57,812 --> 01:46:0-1,644
And look so natural.

1483
01:46:01,732 --> 01:46:03,064
Da-hye.

1484
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:07,277
Do I fit in here?

1485
01:46:09,031 --> 01:46:10,272
What?

1486
01:46:11,242 --> 01:46:14,076
In this setting, do I fit in?

1487
01:46:24,422 --> 01:46:26,414
Hey, where are you going?

1488
01:46:26,924 --> 01:46:28,290
I need to go down.

1489
01:46:28,551 --> 01:46:30,793
Just stay with me.

1490
01:46:31,929 --> 01:46:33,636
I need to go down there.

1491
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:38,885
Why go to those boring people?
Can't you stay here?

1492
01:46:39,854 --> 01:46:44,189
Not to those people, down lower.

1493
01:46:44,734 --> 01:46:47,226
Wow, what is that?

1494
01:46:50,489 --> 01:46:54,108
God, I can't believe
I'm doing this at my age.

1495
01:46:54,827 --> 01:46:56,693
It's so embarrassing.

1496
01:46:57,747 --> 01:47:0-1,454
I'm really sorry, Mr. Kim.

1497
01:47:0-1,624 --> 01:47:02,708
Da-song's mom insisted,
it can't be helped.

1498
01:47:02,919 --> 01:47:04,581
But the concept is simple.

1499
01:47:04,670 --> 01:47:09,916
There'll be a parade with Jessica
carrying a birthday cake.

1500
01:47:10,009 --> 01:47:13,969
Then we jump out and attack Jessica.

1501
01:47:14,055 --> 01:47:16,092
Swinging our tomahawks!

1502
01:47:16,349 --> 01:47:17,307
Right.

1503
01:47:17,308 --> 01:47:22,269
Just then, Da-song the good Indian
will jump out and we'll do battle.

1504
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:27,270
Finally he'll save Jessica the cake princess,
and they'll all cheer.

1505
01:47:27,526 --> 01:47:29,142
Something like that.

1506
01:47:30,321 --> 01:47:31,321
Silly, isn't it?

1507
01:47:31,364 --> 01:47:36,155
I guess your wife likes events
and surprises.

1508
01:47:36,285 --> 01:47:37,947
Yeah, she does.

1509
01:47:38,371 --> 01:47:41,079
But she's particularly
into this party.

1510
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:45,618
You're trying your best, too.

1511
01:47:46,921 --> 01:47:49,629
Well, you love her, after all.

1512
01:47:55,221 --> 01:47:56,553
Mr. Kim.

1513
01:48:0-2,265 --> 01:48:00,552
You're getting paid extra.

1514
01:48:06,023 --> 01:48:10,017
Think of this as part of your work,
okay?

1515
01:48:21,706 --> 01:48:23,197
Did you go down below?

1516
01:48:23,374 --> 01:48:27,163
- Not yet.
- Shouldn't we talk to them?

1517
01:48:27,253 --> 01:48:28,960
Reach an understanding?

1518
01:48:29,088 --> 01:48:30,169
Exactly!

1519
01:48:30,256 --> 01:48:32,839
We all got too fucking worked up
last night.

1520
01:48:32,925 --> 01:48:36,669
Dad was going on about some plan...

1521
01:48:37,346 --> 01:48:39,838
- I'm just going down there.
- Hold on.

1522
01:48:39,932 --> 01:48:42,174
Take this down to them.

1523
01:48:42,268 --> 01:48:43,884
- They must be hungry.
- Right.

1524
01:48:43,978 --> 01:48:45,560
Let them eat first.

1525
01:48:46,689 --> 01:48:48,555
Come next time for sure!

1526
01:48:50,151 --> 01:48:52,188
Here you are, Jessica.

1527
01:48:52,319 --> 01:48:54,561
- This is so amazing.
- Isn't it great?

1528
01:48:54,739 --> 01:48:57,152
I've got a special favor to ask.

1529
01:48:57,283 --> 01:49:0-2,399
What is it?

1530
01:49:0-2,534 --> 01:49:00,821
This is... how to describe it?

1531
01:49:00,911 --> 01:49:02,868
Da-song's trauma recovery cake?

1532
01:49:02,955 --> 01:49:06,073
So it needs to be you who does it.
Today's highlight!

1533
01:50:29,125 --> 01:50:32,334
Hey, are you okay?

1534
01:50:37,716 --> 01:50:39,048
Are you...?

1535
01:50:48,978 --> 01:50:50,469
Wait, mister!

1536
01:52:37,419 --> 01:52:40,127
Kevin? Kevin!

1537
01:52:47,012 --> 01:52:49,846
Da-song, happy birthday!

1538
01:52:49,932 --> 01:52:51,218
Congratulations!

1539
01:53:0-2,649 --> 01:53:0-1,810
Shit...

1540
01:53:09,868 --> 01:53:11,325
<i>Stop!</i>

1541
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:13,953
Chung-sook!

1542
01:53:14,039 --> 01:53:14,998
Ki-jung!

1543
01:53:14,999 --> 01:53:16,285
Come out here, Chung-sook!

1544
01:53:16,375 --> 01:53:19,914
Stop the blood! Push down
on the wound!

1545
01:53:24,758 --> 01:53:25,874
Da-song!

1546
01:53:26,593 --> 01:53:27,674
Honey!

1547
01:53:29,263 --> 01:53:31,095
Let go, don't!

1548
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:43,266
It hurts.

1549
01:53:48,490 --> 01:53:49,526
The emergency room!

1550
01:53:49,616 --> 01:53:50,857
Get the car!

1551
01:53:50,951 --> 01:53:52,863
Mr. Kim!
What are you doing?

1552
01:53:53,037 --> 01:53:55,029
We can't wait for an ambulance!

1553
01:53:55,122 --> 01:53:57,409
Stop pushing, Dad!

1554
01:53:57,583 --> 01:54:00,417
Makes it hurt more.

1555
01:54:01,170 --> 01:54:02,377
Car keys!
The car keys!

1556
01:54:02,463 --> 01:54:04,955
Throw them!
Throw me the keys!

1557
01:54:22,858 --> 01:54:24,190
Are you okay?

1558
01:54:24,735 --> 01:54:26,192
Don't touch it!

1559
01:54:28,697 --> 01:54:30,984
Hello, Mr. Park.

1560
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:32,361
You know me?

1561
01:54:32,451 --> 01:54:33,783
Respect!

1562
01:56:00,747 --> 01:56:04,115
<i>Opening my eyes for the first time
in a month,</i>

1563
01:56:04,209 --> 01:56:05,791
<i>I saw a detective.</i>

1564
01:56:06,086 --> 01:56:10,877
You have the right to
an attorney...

1565
01:56:10,966 --> 01:56:13,083
<i>Who looked nothing like
a detective.</i>

1566
01:56:17,556 --> 01:56:19,218
Is he laughing?

1567
01:56:19,641 --> 01:56:21,098
Just a sec.

1568
01:56:21,685 --> 01:56:26,146
<i>Then the doctor who looked
nothing like a doctor spoke.</i>

1569
01:56:27,524 --> 01:56:31,234
That happens sometimes
after brain surgery.

1570
01:56:31,445 --> 01:56:33,311
They keep laughing.
For no reason.

1571
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:36,322
Do you hear me?

1572
01:56:36,742 --> 01:56:38,449
Can you hear me?

1573
01:56:38,744 --> 01:56:40,485
Then do I have to do it again?

1574
01:56:40,621 --> 01:56:41,537
Do what?

1575
01:56:41,538 --> 01:56:43,074
The Miranda thing.

1576
01:56:45,334 --> 01:56:49,669
You have the right to remain silent.

1577
01:56:49,755 --> 01:56:52,372
Anything you say can and
will be used against you...

1578
01:56:52,466 --> 01:56:54,378
He keeps laughing, look!

1579
01:56:57,763 --> 01:57:03,600
<i>Even when I heard
how much Ki-jung bled that day...</i>

1580
01:57:06,021 --> 01:57:13,021
<i>Even when I heard the words forgery,
trespassing, foul play, self-defense</i>

1581
01:57:13,529 --> 01:57:17,648
<i>and we were lucky
to get away with a probation...</i>

1582
01:57:20,869 --> 01:57:24,033
<i>Even when I finally
got to see Ki-jung's face...</i>

1583
01:57:24,122 --> 01:57:26,739
<i>Kim Ki-jung, RIP</i>

1584
01:57:28,460 --> 01:57:30,577
<i>I kept laughing.</i>

1585
01:57:40,556 --> 01:57:45,802
<i>Still, when I went back
and watched the news reports,</i>

1586
01:57:46,144 --> 01:57:47,555
<i>I didn't laugh.</i>

1587
01:57:47,604 --> 01:57:51,473
This sudden rampage in the back yard
of an upper-class home

1588
01:57:51,567 --> 01:57:53,183
is a highly unusual case.

1589
01:57:53,277 --> 01:57:57,772
Since the homeless man who sparked
the rampage died at the scene,

1590
01:57:57,864 --> 01:58:03,110
police are struggling to
even establish a clear motive.

1591
01:58:03,203 --> 01:58:07,698
The driver Kim and the slain Mr. Park
are said to have been on good terms.

1592
01:58:07,833 --> 01:58:13,170
For now the police investigation is
focused on locating the driver Kim.

1593
01:58:13,714 --> 01:58:17,503
Kim, after exiting this door
and descending the stairs,

1594
01:58:17,801 --> 01:58:20,919
disappeared into the neighboring alleys.

1595
01:58:21,722 --> 01:58:26,717
Police searched the CCTVs
of nearby homes to no avail,

1596
01:58:27,185 --> 01:58:30,349
and they have yet
to find any witnesses.

1597
01:58:30,897 --> 01:58:33,014
Given the situation,

1598
01:58:33,233 --> 01:58:38,149
it's not an exaggeration to say that
Kim vanished into thin air.

1599
01:58:39,615 --> 01:58:46,579
<i>Actually Mom and I had no idea
where Dad was.</i>

1600
01:58:48,915 --> 01:58:54,286
<i>But those detectives
still wore themselves out tailing us.</i>

1601
01:59:0-2,425 --> 01:59:02,135
<i>Eventually the news went quiet,</i>

1602
01:59:02,137 --> 01:59:04,254
<i>and after the tails stopped,</i>

1603
01:59:05,057 --> 01:59:08,221
<i>I started going up that mountain.</i>

1604
01:59:10,479 --> 01:59:14,940
<i>From up there,
you get a great view of the house.</i>

1605
01:59:17,986 --> 01:59:21,696
<i>That day, despite the cold,</i>

1606
01:59:22,574 --> 01:59:25,112
<i>I felt like staying longer.</i>

1607
01:59:38,215 --> 01:59:41,253
Dash-dash-dot-dot

1608
02:00:07,035 --> 02:00:08,321
Son!

1609
02:00:10,414 --> 02:00:11,655
<i>Son!</i>

1610
02:00:13,917 --> 02:00:17,331
<i>Perhaps you, if no one else,
will be able to read this letter.</i>

1611
02:00:21,007 --> 02:00:23,590
<i>You were a Boy Scout,</i>

1612
02:00:23,593 --> 02:00:27,052
<i>so I'm writing this just
in case.</i>

1613
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:33,183
<i>Have your injuries healed?</i>

1614
02:00:34,438 --> 02:00:38,523
<i>I'm sure your mom is
plenty healthy.</i>

1615
02:00:42,654 --> 02:00:45,317
<i>I'm doing fine in here.</i>

1616
02:00:46,533 --> 02:00:49,116
<i>Though thinking of
Ki-jung makes me cry.</i>

1617
02:00:52,581 --> 02:00:56,951
<i>Even now, what happened that day
doesn't seem real.</i>

1618
02:01:0-2,462 --> 02:01:00,499
<i>It feels like a dream,</i>

1619
02:01:01,798 --> 02:01:03,380
<i>and yet it doesn't.</i>

1620
02:01:04,885 --> 02:01:09,220
<i>That day as I went out the gate,
I suddenly knew.</i>

1621
02:01:10,599 --> 02:01:12,386
<i>Where I needed to go...</i>

1622
02:01:52,015 --> 02:01:55,008
<i>A house where such
a grisly crime took place</i>

1623
02:01:55,143 --> 02:01:57,931
<i>would surely not be easy
to sell.</i>

1624
02:02:01,483 --> 02:02:03,850
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.

1625
02:02:04,027 --> 02:02:10,115
<i>I struggled to hold out like that
in an empty house.</i>

1626
02:02:13,036 --> 02:02:15,949
<i>Still, thanks to the house
being empty,</i>

1627
02:02:16,122 --> 02:02:20,913
<i>what was her name?
Moon-gwang?</i>

1628
02:02:21,127 --> 02:02:24,916
<i>I was able to give her
a proper send off.</i>

1629
02:02:26,508 --> 02:02:32,721
<i>I hear tree-side burials are trendy,
so hell, I did my best.</i>

1630
02:02:36,476 --> 02:02:40,015
<i>But those real estate
sharks sure are clever.</i>

1631
02:02:44,651 --> 02:02:49,112
<i>They hoodwinked some people
who hadjust arrived in Korea</i>

1632
02:02:49,197 --> 02:02:51,405
<i>and managed to sell the house.</i>

1633
02:02:52,617 --> 02:02:55,860
<i>With the parents working,
and the kids attending school,</i>

1634
02:02:55,954 --> 02:03:0-2,241
<i>the family is usually out.</i>

1635
02:03:0-2,707 --> 02:03:03,827
<i>But the goddamned housekeeper
stays there 24 hours a day.</i>

1636
02:03:04,296 --> 02:03:08,916
<i>Each time I go upstairs,
I take my life in my hands.</i>

1637
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:15,805
<i>It turns out Germans eat
more than just sausage and beer.</i>

1638
02:03:16,474 --> 02:03:18,340
<i>What a relief.</i>

1639
02:03:21,229 --> 02:03:25,064
<i>Passing the time down here,
everything starts to go hazy.</i>

1640
02:03:29,863 --> 02:03:33,982
<i>Today at least I was able
to write you a letter.</i>

1641
02:03:35,869 --> 02:03:39,863
<i>If I send out the letter
this way every night,</i>

1642
02:03:39,956 --> 02:03:43,996
<i>maybe someday you'll see it.</i>

1643
02:03:50,175 --> 02:03:51,837
<i>So long.</i>

1644
02:04:05,899 --> 02:04:07,140
You're home, Ki-woo?

1645
02:04:07,233 --> 02:04:08,233
Yeah.

1646
02:04:22,499 --> 02:04:27,164
<i>Dad, today I made a plan.</i>

1647
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:30,792
<i>A fundamental plan.</i>

1648
02:04:33,885 --> 02:04:35,717
<i>I'm going to earn money.</i>

1649
02:04:36,471 --> 02:04:38,087
<i>A lot of it.</i>

1650
02:04:41,476 --> 02:04:45,891
<i>University, a career, marriage,
those are all fine,</i>

1651
02:04:46,398 --> 02:04:48,355
<i>but first I'll earn money.</i>

1652
02:04:48,483 --> 02:04:53,524
You'll see once you go in,
but it's very spacious.

1653
02:04:54,447 --> 02:05:0-2,942
Actually, we don't show this house
to just anyone.

1654
02:05:0-1,327 --> 02:05:03,367
<i>When I have money,
I'll buy that house.</i>

1655
02:05:04,624 --> 02:05:08,834
<i>On the day we move in,
Mom and I will be in the yard.</i>

1656
02:05:09,462 --> 02:05:11,795
<i>Because the sunshine is
so nice there.</i>

1657
02:05:13,133 --> 02:05:14,965
<i>All you'll need to do</i>

1658
02:05:15,385 --> 02:05:17,718
<i>is walk up the stairs.</i>

1659
02:06:40,929 --> 02:06:44,548
<i>Take care until then.</i>

1660
02:06:49,729 --> 02:06:51,391
<i>So long.</i>
